Instructions for authors
------------------------

* Rename the directory chapters/foo to something suitable, for example
  karpeev_knepley, scott_terrel or similar.

* Put the text for your chapter in the file chapter.tex in your
  subdirectory.

* Put references in the common file bibliography.bib. Use keys such as
  FooBar2008a, concatenating the first three letters of the last names
  of the first two authors with the year and an additional character
  to separate multiple references by the same authors. The editors
  will sort out any overlapping references/keys later.

* Put any figures directly in your subdirectory.

* Use EPS files for figures in combination with psfrag.

* Use a spell-checker to check your text before submitting.

* Use \index{} to include important terms in the book index.

* Build the book by typing 'make' or 'make final'.

* When you are done, pack up your subdirectory as a tarball and submit
  it together with the file bibliography.bib to one of the editors:

  Anders Logg <logg@simula.no>
  Kent-Andre Mardal <kent-and@simula.no>
  Garth N. Wells <gnw20@cam.ac.uk>
