This is the source code for the "FEniCS Book".

* To build the book, simply type

  make final

* For "quick" build (not including bibliography and index), simply type

  make

* A number of scripts are provided to check for errors:

  ./proofread.sh      (this checks for common typos and inconsistencies)
  ./spellcheck.sh     (this runs a spellchecker on all chapters)
  ./check.sh          (this checks that the book builds without warnings)

* The file named TODO contains a list of things that need to be fixed
  by the editors, the publisher and the authors.

* The BPF form is located inside the folder springer/forms.

* CTP forms will be submitted separately.

* The repository for the book is located at

  https://launchpad.net/fenics-book

* The plan forward is:

  1. Submission to publisher
  2. Proofreading / production by publisher (check TODO file for comments)
  3. Checking of proofs by all authors (check TODO file for comments)
  4. Production of final book by publisher

  Note that during step 3, all authors will need to check all their code
  examples and make sure that they work with the latest version of the
  FEniCS interface (1.0). Authors will then also need to add items to the
  book index if missing.
