This repository contains all files for the FEniCS book.

Instructions for authors
------------------------

* All files for chapter [foo] are located in the subdirectory chapters/foo.

* Write the chapter in chapters/foo/chapter.tex.

* Put SVG and EPS files under

    chapters/foo/svg
    chapters/foo/eps

* References are stored in the common file bibliography.bib. If you find
  that a reference is missing, submit it to one of the editors in BibTeX
  format and it will be imported into the common bibliography.

  Most (all?) references used in the currently included chapters have been
  imported into the common bibliography using JabRef with keys [authors2][year]
  but the citations have not been updated in all chapters.

* All labels inside a chapter should be prefixed by the chapter prefix.
  For chapter [foo], the following labels should be used:

    \label{foo:eq:bar}  for equations
    \label{foo:fig:bar} for figures
    \label{foo:alg:bar} for algorithms
    \label{foo:sec:bar} for sections

* All chapters are automatically labeled by their prefix.
  To refer to another chapter named [foo], use

    In Chapter~\ref{chap:foo}, ...

* Only use EPS figures. We rely on psfrag for replacement of text
  in figures and so cannot use pdflatex.

* Use psfrag to replace axis labels etc with LaTeX:

    \psfrag{x}{$x$}
    \psfrag{y}{$y$}

* Use Inkscape to draw figures. You can use one of the SVG files from
  chapter [kirby-6] as a template for line widths and colors.

* Use a spell checker (American English).

* Use \index{} to include important terms in the book index.

* Build the book by typing 'make' (for DVI) or 'make final' (for PDF).

* Send comments and questions to fenics-book@fenics.org.

* This repository is primarily intended for editing. Developing the
  text itself should preferrably be done offline (or online in another
  repository) as not to flood the mailing list with very frequent
  commits for all 40 chapters.
