Each lesion was characterized by thickening, lamination, redundancy, and separation of basement membranes, abundant cellular debris, and a paucity or absence of elastica. In several instances, extracellular lipid and lipophages were present. These vascular lesions were remarkably similar to one another and also to the degenerative changes in experimental arteriovenous aneurysms, thus substantiating the concept that they, too, are essentially degenerative in nature.

doi = {},
year = {2002},
abstract = {Phase-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a well-known but undervalued method of
obtaining quantitative information on blood flow. Applications of this technique in cardiovascular MR imaging
are expanding. According to the sequences available, phase-contrast measurement can be performed
in a breath hold or during normal respiration. Prospective as well as retrospective gating techniques can
be used. Common errors in phase-contrast imaging include mismatched encoding velocity, deviation of the
imaging plane, inadequate temporal resolution, inadequate spatial resolution, accelerated flow and
spatial misregistration, and phase offset errors. Flow measurements are most precise if the imaging plane
is perpendicular to the vessel of interest and flow encoding is set to through-plane flow.
The sequence should be repeated at least once, with a high encoding velocity used initially.
If peak velocity has to be estimated, flow measurement is repeated with an adapted encoding velocity.
The overall error of a phase-contrast flow measurement comprises errors during prescription as
well as errors that occur during image analysis of the flow data. With phase-
contrast imaging, the overall error in flow measurement can be reduced to less than 10%,
an acceptable level of error for routine clinical use.

journal = {AJNR Am J Neuroradiol},
volume = {26},
number = {4},
pages = {730-735},
year = {2005},
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The index of mean blood flow velocity (V) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) divided by respective velocity in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA), or VMCA/VICA index, is commonly used as a marker of vasospasm, although reference values are not established. We sought to provide reference data for these velocities and index.  METHODS: Transcranial color-coded duplex and carotid duplex sonography was performed in 335 healthy volunteers (211 women, 124 men; mean age {+/-} SD, 42 {+/-} 18 years; range, 18-86 years). Age analyses were based on three groups: I, <40; II, 40-60; and III, >60 years. The VMCA/VICA index was calculated based on angle-corrected blood flow velocities determined in the MCA and extracranial ICA.  RESULTS: Mean flow velocities in the MCA and ICA diminished with increasing age, most pronounced in those subjects >40 years. The VMCA/VICA index increased significantly (1.67 + 0.005 [age]; P < .05) with age in women, but not in men. In women, reference values and ranges for the VMCA/VICA index were as follows, by group: I, 1.82 (range, 0.88-2.68); II, 1.91 (range, 0.94-2.88); and III, 2.06 (range, 0.59-3.53). Respective values for men were as follows, by group: I, 2.10 (range, 0.96-3.24); II, 2.04 (range, 0.71-3.37); and III, 1.78 (range, 0.81-2.75). In subjects <40 years, the VMCA/VICA index was significantly higher in men than in women.  CONCLUSION: The VMCA/VICA index significantly varies with age and sex. Sonographic diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm should be based on age- and sex-adjusted reference values of the VMCA/VICA index.

abstract = {A central problem in modeling blood flow and pressure in the larger systemic arteries is determining a physiologically based boundary condition so that the arterial tree can be truncated after a few generations. We have used a structured tree attached to the terminal branches of the truncated arterial tree in which the root impedance is estimated using a semianalytical approach based on a linearization of the viscous axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. This provides a dynamic boundary condition that maintains the phase lag between blood flow and pressure as well as the high-frequency oscillations present in the impedance spectra. Furthermore, it accommodates the wave propagation effects for the entire systemic arterial tree. The result is a model that is physiologically adequate as well as computationally feasible. For validation, we have compared the structured tree model with a pure resistance and a windkessel model as well as with measured data.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to quantify the acute changes in endothelial histology that are associated with an induced increase in blood velocity. A nontraumatic intra-aortic device was designed to produce a rapid convergence of the aortic blood stream into a narrow channel along the ventral aspect of the thoracic aorta in dogs. The endothelial surface overlying this channel was exposed to a broad range of surface shearing stress by the accelerated blood flow. Techniques were developed to quantify the resulting distribution of shearing stress so that the stress to which the endothelial surface was exposed at every point along the channel could be determined. Special histologic techniques were developed using formalin fixation and gelatin embedding of the tissue so that endothelial cytology could be studied and criteria for normal cells established. Using these criteria, cell counts were done to establish the "normal" endothelial cell population density as a function of stress exposure. The stress corresponding to the mode of these cell density distribution curves was defined as the acute yield stress ({tau}c). The acute yield stress for endothelial cells was found to be 379{+/-}85 (SD) dynes/cm2. Exposure to stress in excess of this value for periods as short as one hour resulted in marked deterioration of the endothelial surface consisting of endothelial cytoplasmic swelling, cell deformation, cell disintegration, and finally dissolution and erosion of cell substance.

abstract = {Background and Purpose-- Evolution of intracranial aneurysmal disease is known to be related to hemodynamic forces acting on the vessel wall. Low wall shear stress (WSS) has been reported to have a negative effect on endothelial cells normal physiology and may be an important contributor to local remodeling of the arterial wall and to aneurysm growth and rupture.  Methods-- Seven patient-specific models of intracranial aneurysms were constructed using MR angiography data acquired at two different time points (mean 16.4{+/-}7.4 months between the two time points). Numeric simulations of the flow in the baseline geometries were performed to compute WSS distributions. The lumenal geometries constructed from the two time points were manually coregistered, and the radial displacement of the wall was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This displacement, corresponding to the local growth of the aneurysm, was compared to the time-averaged wall shear stress (WSSTA) through the cardiac cycle at that location. For statistical analysis, radial displacement was considered to be significant if it was larger than half of the MR pixel resolution (0.3 mm).  Results-- Mean WSSTA values obtained for the areas with a displacement smaller and greater than 0.3 mm were 2.55{+/-}3.6 and 0.76{+/-}1.5 Pa, respectively (P<0.001). A linear correlation analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between WSSTA and surface displacement (P<0.001).  Conclusions-- These results indicate that aneurysm growth is likely to occur in regions where the endothelial layer lining the vessel wall is exposed to abnormally low wall shear stress.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamic factors are thought to play an important role in the initiation, growth, and rupture of cerebral aneurysms. This report describes a pilot clinical study of the association between intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic characteristics from computational fluid dynamic models and the rupture of cerebral aneurysms.  METHODS: A total of 62 patient-specific models of cerebral aneurysms were constructed from 3D angiography images. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed under pulsatile flow conditions measured on a normal subject. The aneurysms were classified into different categories, depending on the complexity and stability of the flow pattern, the location and size of the flow impingement region, and the size of the inflow jet. The 62 models consisted of 25 ruptured and 34 unruptured aneurysms and 3 cases with unknown histories of hemorrhage. The hemodynamic features were analyzed for associations with history of rupture.  RESULTS: A large variety of flow patterns was observed: 72% of ruptured aneurysms had complex or unstable flow patterns, 80% had small impingement regions, and 76% had small jet sizes. By contrast, unruptured aneurysms accounted for 73%, 82%, and 75% of aneurysms with simple stable flow patterns, large impingement regions, and large jet sizes, respectively. Aneurysms with small impingement sizes were 6.3 times more likely to have experienced rupture than those with large impingement sizes (P = .01).  CONCLUSIONS: Image-based patient-specific numeric models can be constructed in an efficient manner that allows clinical studies of intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics. A simple flow characterization system was proposed, and interesting trends in the association between hemodynamic features and aneurysmal rupture were found. Simple stable patterns, large impingement regions, and jet sizes were more commonly seen with unruptured aneurysms. By contrast, ruptured aneurysms were more likely to have disturbed flow patterns, small impingement regions, and narrow jets.

	the accuracy of approximations to solutions of elliptic partial differential

	tions. It is shown that, by solving appropriate local residual type
	problems, one can

	obtain upper bounds on the error in the energy norm. Moreover, in
	the special case

	of adaptive h-p finite element analysis, the estimator will also give
	a realistic

	estimate of the error. A key feature of this is the development of
	a systematic

	approach to the determination of boundary conditions for the local
	problems. The

	work extends and combines several existing methods to the case of
	full h-p finite

	element approximation on possibly irregular meshes with elements of
	non-uniform

	degree. As a special case, the analysis proves a conjecture made by
	Bank and

	Weiser [Some A Posteriori Error Estimators for Elliptic Partial Differential

	Equations, Math. Comput. 44, 283-301 (1985)].},

  abstract = {1. The mechanisms that control release of {C}a$^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasmic
	reticulum (SR) of guinea-pig ventricular cells were studied by observing
	intracellular calcium concentration ([{C}a$^{2+}$]i transients) and
	membrane currents in voltage-clamped guinea-pig ventricular myocytes
	perfused internally with Fura-2. 2. Sarcolemmal {C}a$^{2+}$ current
	was identified through the use of tetrodotoxin ({TTX}) and {C}a$^{2+}$
	channel antagonists (verapamil) and agonists (Bay K 8644). 3. Changes
	in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i attributable to release of {C}a$^{2+}$ from the
	SR were identified through the use of ryanodine, which abolishes
	the ability of the SR to release {C}a$^{2+}$. Ryanodine-sensitive
	increases in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i could be elicited either by depolarization
	or by repolarization (from depolarizing pulses to relatively positive
	membrane potentials). 4. At appropriate voltages, it is the initial
	fast change in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i elicited by either depolarization or
	repolarization that is abolished by ryanodine, and is defined here
	as ryanodine sensitive. 5. The amplitude of the ryanodine-sensitive
	[{C}a$^{2+}$]i transient elicited by depolarization had a bell-shaped
	dependence on membrane potential with a maximum of about 500 nM at
	10 mV, and with the upper minimum between 60 and 70 mV. Verapamil-sensitive
	current activated over approximately the same potential range as
	the [{C}a$^{2+}$]i transient, with a peak amplitude at 10 mV, and
	a reversal potential of 65 mV. 6. When a holding potential of -68
	mV and {TTX} (30 microM) were used, the most negative pulse potential
	at which activation of an inward current occurred was -49 mV while
	changes in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i occurred at -43 mV. 7. Ryanodine-sensitive
	increases in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i elicited by repolarization (tail transients)
	were maximal for repolarization to 0 mV. Smaller changes in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i
	than maximal were elicited by repolarization to both more positive
	and more negative potentials than 0 mV. The peak amplitude of the
	verapamil-sensitive tail currents elicited by repolarization increased
	continuously as the membrane was repolarized to potentials more negative
	than 60 mV. 8. Increasing depolarizing pulse duration beyond 10-20
	ms did not increase the amplitude of the [{C}a$^{2+}$]i transient,
	but prolonged it. 9. The experimental results are compared to the
	predictions of two theories on the mechanism of excitation-contraction
	coupling: {C}a$^{2+}$-induced release of {C}a$^{2+}$ (CICR), as it
	has been formulated from data in skinned cardiac cells, and a charge-coupled
	release mechanism ({CCRM}), as it has been formulated to explain
	excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. 10. Some of the
	results are clearly not consistent with certain features of a charge-coupled
	release mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Numerical linear algebra, particularly the solution of linear systems
	of equations, linear least squares problems, eigenvalue problems
	and singular value problems, is fundamental to most calculations
	in scientific computing, and is often the computationally intense
	part of such calculations. Designers of computer programs involving
	linear algebraic operations have frequently chosen to implement certain
	low level operations, such as the dot product or the matrix vector
	product, as separate subprograms. This may be observed both in many
	published codes and in codes written for specific applications at
	many computer installations.\par

	A major aim of the standards defined in this paper is to enable linear
	algebra libraries (both public domain and commercial) to interoperate

	{C}a$^{2+}$ release, and ER/SR stress-mediated cell death. We report
	rapid and substantial decreases in luminal [{C}a$^{2+}$], called
	"{C}a$^{2+}$ blinks," within nanometer-sized stores (the junctional
	cisternae of the SR) during elementary {C}a$^{2+}$ release events

	{C}a$^{2+}$,or{C}a$^{2+}$ sparks, but changes of [{C}a$^{2+}$] in
	the connected free SR network were below detection. Store microanatomy
	suggests that diffusional strictures may account for this paradox.
	Surprisingly, the nadir of the store depletion trails the peak of
	the spark by about 10 ms, and the refilling of local store occurs
	with a rate constant of 35 s(-1), which is approximately 6-fold faster
	than the recovery of local {C}a$^{2+}$ release after a spark. These
	data suggest that both local store depletion and some time-dependent
	inhibitory mechanism contribute to spark termination and refractoriness.
	Visualization of local store {C}a$^{2+}$ signaling thus broadens
	our understanding of cardiac store {C}a$^{2+}$ regulation and function
	and opens the possibility for local regulation of diverse store-dependent
	functions.},

	of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear
	advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical
	examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes
	equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient
	algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the
	incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within
	a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on
	the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds

	suppose that the exact solution

	has a certain regularity or the numerical scheme enjoys some saturation
	property. For coarse meshes

	those asymptotic arguments are difficult to recast into rigorous error
	bounds. The aim of this paper

	is to provide reliable computable error bounds which are efficient
	and complete in the sense that

	constants are estimated as well. The main argument is a localization
	via a partition of unity which

	leads to problems on small domains. Two fully reliable estimates are
	established: The sharper

	one solves an analytical interface problem with residuals following
	Babuˇka and Rheinboldt [SIAM

	s

	J. Numer. Anal., 15 (1978), pp. 736–754]. The second estimate is a
	modification of the standard

	residual-based a posteriori estimate with explicit constants from
	local analytical eigenvalue problems.

	For some class of triangulations we show that the efficiency constant
	is smaller than 2.5. According

	to our numerical experience, the overestimation of our computable
	estimates proved to be reasonably

	small, with an overestimation by a factor between 2.5 and 4 only.},

	Based on Eulerian and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Variational Formulations}},
  school = {Universit{\"a}tsbibliothek},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Aim of this work is the examination of numerical methods for fluid-structure
	interaction

	(FSI) problems. We use two approaches for the modelling of FSI problems.
	The well-known

	?arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian? (ALE) approach as well as an unusual
	fully Eulerian approach. For both frameworks we derive a general
	variational

	framework for the adaptive finite element approximation of FSI problems.

	The focal points of this thesis are the comparison of the ALE and
	the novel Eulerian approaches

	and the application of the ?dual weighted residual? (DWR) method to
	FSI problems.

	The DWR method is the basis of two techniques, a posteriori error
	estimation and

	goal-oriented mesh adaptivity.

	Based on the developed models of FSI we apply the DWR method for a
	posteriori error

	estimation and goal-oriented mesh adaptation to FSI problems. Necessary
	aspects of DWR

	method and implementation for the ALE and Eulerian approach are discussed.Several
	stationary as well as nonstationary examples are presented using
	both the ALE as

	well as the Eulerian framework. Results from both frameworks are in
	good agreement with

	each other. Also for both frameworks the DWR method is successfully
	applied.

	Finally using benchmark results from the DFG joint research group
	FOR 493 (of which the

	author is a participating member) the discussed methods are verified
	for both frameworks.},

	Differentiation of Algorithms: Theory, Implementation, and Application,
	1991, pp. 126--135). We introduce the necessary theory in terms of
	well known algorithms of numerical linear algebra applied to the
	linear, extended Jacobian system that prescribes the relationship
	between the derivatives of all variables in the function code. Using
	an example, we highlight the potential for numerical instability
	in vertex-elimination. We describe the source transformation implementation
	of our tool {EliAD} and present results from five test cases, four
	of which are taken from the {MINPACK-2} collection {(Averick} et
	al, Report {ANL/MCS-TM-150,} 1992) and for which hand-coded Jacobian
	codes are available. On five computer/compiler platforms, we show
	that the Jacobian code obtained by {EliAD} is as efficient as hand-coded
	Jacobian code. It is also between 2 to 20 times more efficient than
	that produced by current, state of the art, Automatic Differentiation
	tools even when such tools make use of sophisticated techniques such
	as sparse Jacobian compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness
	of reverse-ordered pre-elimination from the (successively updated)
	extended Jacobian system of all intermediate variables used once.
	Thereafter, the monotonic forward/reverse ordered eliminations of
	all other intermediates is shown to be very efficient. On only one
	test case were orderings determined by the Markowitz or related {VLR}
	heuristics found superior. A re-ordering of the statements of the
	Jacobian code, with the aim of reducing reads and writes of data
	from cache to registers, was found to have mixed effects but could
	be very beneficial.},

	The adjoint model computes the gradient of a cost function with respect
	to control variables. Generation of adjoint code may be seen as the
	special case of differentiation of algorithms in reverse mode, where
	the dependent function is a scalar. The described method for adjoint
	code generation is based on a few basic principles, which permits
	the establishment of simple construction rules for adjoint statements
	and complete adjoint subprograms. These rules are presented and illustrated
	with some examples. Conflicts that occur due to loops and redefinition
	of variables are also discussed. Direct coding of the adjoint of
	a more sophisticated model is extremely time consuming and subject
	to errors. Hence, automatic generation of adjoint code represents
	a distinct advantage. An implementation of the method, described
	in this article, is the tangent linear and adjoint model compiler

  abstract = {The local control theory of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in
	cardiac muscle asserts that L-type {C}a$^{2+}$ current tightly controls
	{C}a$^{2+}$ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via local
	interaction of closely apposed L-type {C}a$^{2+}$ channels (LCCs)
	and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). These local interactions give rise
	to smoothly graded {C}a$^{2+}$-induced {C}a$^{2+}$ release (CICR),
	which exhibits high gain. In this study we present a biophysically
	detailed model of the normal canine ventricular myocyte that conforms
	to local control theory. The model formulation incorporates details
	of microscopic EC coupling properties in the form of {C}a$^{2+}$
	release units (Ca{RU}s) in which individual sarcolemmal LCCs interact
	in a stochastic manner with nearby RyRs in localized regions where
	junctional SR membrane and transverse-tubular membrane are in close
	proximity. The Ca{RU}s are embedded within and interact with the
	global systems of the myocyte describing ionic and membrane pump/exchanger
	currents, SR {C}a$^{2+}$ uptake, and time-varying cytosolic ion concentrations
	to form a model of the cardiac action potential (AP). The model can

  abstract = {Little is known about the native properties of unitary cardiac L-type
	calcium currents (i(Ca)) measured with physiological calcium (Ca)
	ion concentration, and their role in excitation-contraction (E-C)
	coupling. Our goal was to chart the concentration-dependence of unitary
	conductance (gamma) to physiological Ca concentration and compare
	it to barium ion (Ba) conductance in the absence of agonists. In
	isolated, K-depolarized rat myocytes, i(Ca) amplitudes were measured
	using cell-attached patches with 2 to 70 mM Ca or 2 to 105 mM Ba
	in the pipette. At 0 mV, 2 mM of Ca produced 0.12 pA, and 2 mM of
	Ba produced 0.19 pA unitary currents. Unitary conductance was described
	by a Langmuir isotherm relationship with a maximum gammaCa of 5.3
	+/- 0.2 pS (n = 15), and gammaBa of 15 +/- 1 pS (n = 27). The concentration
	producing half-maximal gamma, Kd(gamma), was not different between
	Ca (1.7 +/- 0.3 mM) and Ba (1.9 +/- 0.4 mM). We found that quasi-physiological
	concentrations of Ca produced currents that were as easily resolvable
	as those obtained with the traditionally used higher concentrations.
	This study leads to future work on the molecular basis of E-C coupling
	with a physiological concentration of Ca ions permeating the Ca channel.},

	in the ventricular myocyte that includes novel descriptions of subcellular
	mechanisms based on recent experimental findings: 1) the Keizer-Levine
	model for the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which displays adaptation
	at elevated {C}a$^{2+}$; 2) a model for the L-type {C}a$^{2+}$ channel
	that inactivates by mode switching; and 3) a restricted subspace
	into which the RyRs and L-type {C}a$^{2+}$ channels empty and interact
	via {C}a$^{2+}$. We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase
	II ventricular cell model to our description of {C}a$^{2+}$ handling
	to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and {C}a$^{2+}$
	regulation. The model can simulate {C}a$^{2+}$ transients during
	an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace
	[{C}a$^{2+}$] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30
	microM) than the bulk myoplasmic {C}a$^{2+}$ (peak [{C}a$^{2+}$]i
	approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
	{C}a$^{2+}$ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but
	is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly
	proportional to peak myoplasmic {C}a$^{2+}$, we use [{C}a$^{2+}$]i
	in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation.
	The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to
	changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation
	of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation
	and the degree of SR {C}a$^{2+}$ loading. This model, therefore,
	shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions
	of subcellular {C}a$^{2+}$ regulatory mechanisms.},

	occur locally in minute periplasmic subspaces often referred to as
	signaling microdomains. The number of signaling molecules in these
	microdomains is small enough to render the notion of continuous concentration
	changes invalid, such that signaling events are better described
	using stochastic rather than deterministic methods. Of particular
	interest is the dyadic cleft in the cardiac myocyte, where short-lived,
	local increases in intracellular {C}a$^{2+}$ known as {C}a$^{2+}$
	sparks regulate excitation-contraction coupling. The geometry of
	dyadic spaces can alter in disease and development and display significant
	inter-species variability. We created and studied a 3D Monte Carlo
	model of the dyadic cleft, specifying the spatial localization of
	L-type {C}a$^{2+}$ channels and ryanodine receptors. Our analysis
	revealed how reaction specificity and efficiency are regulated by
	microdomain geometry as well as the physical separation of signaling
	molecules into functional complexes. The spark amplitude and rise
	time were found to be highly dependent on the concentration of activated
	channels per dyadic cleft and on the intermembrane separation, but
	not very sensitive to other cleft dimensions. The role of L-type
	{C}a$^{2+}$ channel and ryanodine receptor phosphorylation was also
	examined. We anticipate that this modeling approach may be applied
	to other systems (e.g., neuronal growth cones and chemotactic cells)
	to create a general description of stochastic events in {C}a$^{2+}$
	signaling.},

	The approach implemented in {AceGen} avoids the usual problem of

  abstract = {We model the space between the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum ({JSR})
	membrane and the inner leaflet of the transverse tubular ("T") sarcolemmal
	({SL}) membrane, the diadic cleft, with respect to calcium (Ca) concentration
	and movement. The model predicts the following: 1) Ca influx via
	the "L" channel increases [Ca] to 1 microM within a distance of 50
	nm from the channel mouth in < 500 microseconds. This is sufficient
	to trigger Ca release from a domain of 9 "feet." 2) By contrast,
	"reverse" Na/Ca exchange will increase [Ca] to approximately 0.5
	microM throughout the cleft space in 10 ms, sufficient to trigger
	Ca release, but clearly to a lesser extent and more slowly than the
	channel. 3) After a 20-ms {JSR} release into the cleft via the "feet"
	[Ca] peaks at 600 microM (cleft center) to 100 microM (cleft periphery)
	and then declines to diastolic level (100 nM) within 150 ms throughout
	the cleft. 4) The ratio of flux out of the cleft via Na/Ca exchange
	to flux out of the cleft to the cytosol varies inversely as {JSR}
	Ca release. 5) Removal of {SL} anionic Ca-binding sites from the
	model will cause [Ca] to fall to 100 nM throughout the cleft in <
	1 ms after {JSR} release ceases. This markedly reduces Na/Ca exchange.
	6) Removal from or decreased concentration of Na/Ca exchangers in
	the cleft will cause [Ca] to fall too slowly after {JSR} release
	to permit triggered release upon subsequent excitation.},

	potential adjacent to bilayer membranes. When the membranes were
	formed from mixtures of {PI} and the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine
	({PC}), the Gouy-Chapman-Stern ({GCS}) theory described adequately
	the dependence of potential on distance (0, 1, 2 nm) from the membrane,

	probes reported identical surface potentials with a {PC}/{PI} membrane.
	With {PC}/{PIP}2 membranes, however, the anionic (coion) probes reported
	less negative potentials than the cationic (counterion) probes; the
	deviations from the {GCS} theory were greater for the coions than
	the counterions. Discreteness-of-charge theories based on the Poisson-Boltzmann
	equation incorrectly predict that deviations from the {GCS} theory

	statistical mechanical theory that takes into account three effects
	ignored in the {GCS} theory: the finite size of the ions in the double
	layer, the electrical interaction between pairs of ions (correlation
	effects), and the mobile discrete nature of the surface charges.
	This theory correctly predicts that deviations from {GCS} theory

	the discretization of differential

	equations, taking as input a variational problem, a finite element

	a system of discrete equations. However, the generality of the framework

	This paper reviews ongoing research in the direction of a complete

	In particular, this work discusses algorithms for the efficient and
	automatic computation of a system of

	discrete equations from a given variational problem, finite element
	and mesh. It is demonstrated that by

	automatically generating and compiling efficient low-level code, it
	is possible to parametrize a finite element

  organization = {Springer},
  abstract = {Why anisotropy? The straightforward answer to this question could
	be: because anisotropy is everywhere! Actually, when numerically
	solving a problem in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), or in some
	other areas, there are many instances where the solution shows directional
	features such as great variations along certain directions with less
	significant changes along other ones, e.g. boundary and internal
	layers, singularities or shocks. A correct orientation and deformation
	of the mesh elements (longest edges parallel to, e.g. the boundary
	layers) yields a great reduction of the number of triangles. Moreover,
	in the anisotropic case the layers are captured more sharply. The
	leitmotiv of an anisotropic analysis can be stated as: for a fixed
	solution accuracy, reduced the number of degrees of freedom involved
	in the approximation of the problem at hand by better orienting the
	mesh elements according to some suitable features of the solution,
	or vice versa, given a contraint on the number of elements, find
	the mesh maximizing the accuracy of the numerical solution. However,
	things may not be so straightforward. While anisotropy is proved
	to superior in terms of effectiveness for the most accurate computations
	in many cases, yet, there are some instances where a structured Adaptive
	Mesh Refinement (AMR) procedure turns out to be more simple to carry
	out, especially in view of an implementation in a parallel environment.
	Moreover, in the unstructured case, the main drawback of the anisotropic
	approach compared to the anisotropic one, is the more complex analysis
	required to fully describe the element dimensions and orientation.
	Though, this heavier burden is the strenght of the method. The outline
	of the article is the following. In the Sect. 2 we introduce the
	anisotropic framework by recalling some anisotropic interpolation
	error estimates, representing the main tool used in the a posteriori
	error analysis addressed in Sect. 3. This analysis is discussed in
	the case of a general differential operator, moving from the adjoint
	theory for goal-oriented error control, and it is then detailed for
	the advection-diffusion-reaction and the Stokes problems. Finally,
	in Sect. 4 the effectiveness of the anisotropic philosophy is assessed
	on some numerical test cases.},

	Ca release from the "feet" of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This region
	is modeled as a disc 10 nm thick, 430 nm in radius, with or without
	Ca binding sites and open at its periphery to the cytosol. [Ca] is
	computed for three diffusion coefficients (100, 20 and 4\% of aqueous
	diffusion), following release of a 20-msec square pulse sufficient
	to produce 50\% maximal contractile force, or repetitive release
	(400/min) of such pulses. Numerical solutions are obtained for the
	general diffusion/binding problem and analytic solutions for the
	case of no binding sites. For the middle value of diffusion coefficient,
	and in the absence of binding sites, [Ca] rises to approximately
	1.5 mM in 20-msec and then falls to approximately 0.1 microM in less
	than 3 msec. Adding binding sites reduces peak [Ca] to approximately
	0.6 mM but prolongs its decline, requiring approximately 200 msec
	to reach 20 microM. For repetitive release [Ca] is greater than 100
	microM for roughly half of each cycle. Two major implications of
	the predicted [Ca] are: (i) The effect of Ca binding sites on [Ca]
	will cause Ca efflux from the cleft via the Na-Ca exchanger (Km(Ca)
	approximately 20 microM) to continue at a significant level for greater
	than 200 msec. (ii) The time constant for inactivation of release
	from the "feet" must be much greater than for activation if Ca-induced
	Ca release is to continue for greater than 1-2 msec.},

  abstract = {Intracellular calcium release is a prime example for the role of stochastic
	effects in cellular systems. Recent models consist of deterministic
	reaction-diffusion equations coupled to stochastic transitions of
	calcium channels. The resulting dynamics is of multiple time and
	spatial scales, which complicates far-reaching computer simulations.
	In this article, we introduce a novel hybrid scheme that is especially
	tailored to accurately trace events with essential stochastic variations,
	while deterministic concentration variables are efficiently and accurately
	traced at the same time. We use finite elements to efficiently resolve
	the extreme spatial gradients of concentration variables close to
	a channel. We describe the algorithmic approach and we demonstrate
	its efficiency compared to conventional methods. Our single-channel
	model matches experimental data and results in intriguing dynamics
	if calcium is used as charge carrier. Random openings of the channel
	accumulate in bursts of calcium blips that may be central for the
	understanding of cellular calcium dynamics.},

	of that operator, due to the need to distinguish perturbations introduced
	by distinct invocations. We exhibit a series of implementations of
	a referentially-transparent {forward-mode-AD} derivative-taking operator,
	each of which uses a different non-referentially-transparent mechanism
	to distinguish perturbations. Even though the {forward-mode-AD} derivative-taking
	operator is itself referentially transparent, we hypothesize that
	one cannot correctly formulate this operator as a function definition
	in current pure dialects of Haskell.},

  abstract = {The transverse tubular system (t-system) of cardiac muscle is a structure
	that allows rapid propagation of excitation into the cell interior.
	Using 2-photon molecular excitation microscopy and digital image-processing
	methods, we have obtained a comprehensive overview of the t-system
	of rat ventricular myocytes in living cells. We show that it is possible
	to quantify the morphology of the t-system in terms of average local
	tubule diameter, branching pattern, and local abundance of the t-system
	by immersing living myocytes in a dextran-linked fluorescein solution.
	Our data suggest that previous electron microscopic examinations
	of t-system structure have underestimated both the geometric complexity
	of the t-system morphology and the fraction of cell volume occupied
	by the t-system (3.6\% in this species). About 40\% of tubules occur
	between Z-lines, and the t-tubule diameter is 255+/-0.85 nm (mean+/-SEM).
	The t-tubules leave the outer surface of the cell in an approximately
	rectangular array; however, at some points junctions between the
	t-tubules and the surface membrane are missing. In view of the complexity
	of the t-system apparent from our images, we propose that the t-system
	be renamed the "sarcolemmal Z rete." The methods presented here are
	generally applicable to the quantification of the sarcolemmal Z rete
	and other structures within cells by fluorescence microscopy in a
	variety of cell types.},

  abstract = {Computer simulation was used to investigate the calcium levels after
	sarcolemmal calcium influx through L-type calcium channels (DHPRs)
	into the narrow diadic space of cardiac muscle. The effect of various
	cytosolic and membranebound buffers, diad geometry, DHPR properties
	(open time and current), and surface charge were examined. The simulations
	showed that phospholipid binding sites on the sarcolemmal membrane
	are the major buffer affecting free calcium ([{C}a$^{2+}$]) levels
	in the diad. The inclusion of surface charge effects calculated from
	Gouy-Chapman theory resulted in a marked decrease in [{C}a$^{2+}$]
	levels at all times and a faster decay of [{C}a$^{2+}$] after termination
	of DHPR influx. For a DHPR current of 200 fA, [{C}a$^{2+}$] at the
	center of the diad reached peak levels of approximately 73 microM.
	In larger diads (> or = 400 nm diameter), [{C}a$^{2+}$] decayed more
	slowly than in smaller diads (100-200 nm diameter), although peak
	[{C}a$^{2+}$] levels reached during typical DHPR open times were
	similar. For a wide range of DHPR single-channel current magnitudes
	(Ica = 25-200 fA), [{C}a$^{2+}$] levels in the diad were approximately
	proportional to ICa. The decrease in calculated [{C}a$^{2+}$] levels
	due to the effects of surface charge can be interpreted as resulting
	from an effective "volume expansion" of the diad space. Furthermore,
	the layer of increased [{C}a$^{2+}$] close to the sarcolemmal membrane
	can act as a fast buffer.},

	reticulum occurs by calcium- induced calcium release through ryanodine
	receptors (RyRs), which are clustered in a dense, regular, two-dimensional
	lattice array at the diad junction. We simulated numerically the
	stochastic dynamics of RyRs and L-type sarcolemmal calcium channels
	interacting via calcium nano-domains in the junctional cleft. Four
	putative RyR gating schemes based on single-channel measurements
	in lipid bilayers all failed to give stable excitation-contraction
	coupling, due either to insufficiently strong inactivation to terminate
	locally regenerative calcium-induced calcium release or insufficient
	cooperativity to discriminate against RyR activation by background
	calcium. If the ryanodine receptor was represented, instead, by a
	phenomenological four-state gating scheme, with channel opening resulting
	from simultaneous binding of two {C}a$^{2+}$ ions, and either calcium-dependent
	or activation-linked inactivation, the simulations gave a good semiquantitative
	accounting for the macroscopic features of excitation-contraction
	coupling. It was possible to restore stability to a model based on
	a bilayer-derived gating scheme, by introducing allosteric interactions
	between nearest-neighbor RyRs so as to stabilize the inactivated
	state and produce cooperativity among calcium binding sites on different
	RyRs. Such allosteric coupling between RyRs may be a function of
	the foot process and lattice array, explaining their conservation
	during evolution.},

	coupling take place in spatially restricted microdomains known as
	dyads. The movement and dynamics of calcium ({C}a$^{2+}$) ions in
	the dyad have often been described by assigning continuously valued
	{C}a$^{2+}$ concentrations to one or more dyadic compartments. However,
	even at its peak, the estimated number of free {C}a$^{2+}$ ions present
	in a single dyad is small (approximately 10-100 ions). This in turn
	suggests that modeling dyadic calcium dynamics using laws of mass
	action may be inappropriate. In this study, we develop a model of
	stochastic molecular signaling between L-type {C}a$^{2+}$ channels
	(LCCs) and ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) that describes: a), known
	features of dyad geometry, including the space-filling properties
	of key dyadic proteins; and b), movement of individual {C}a$^{2+}$
	ions within the dyad, as driven by electrodiffusion. The model enables
	investigation of how local {C}a$^{2+}$ signaling is influenced by
	dyad structure, including the configuration of key proteins within
	the dyad, the location of {C}a$^{2+}$ binding sites, and membrane
	surface charges. Using this model, we demonstrate that LCC-RyR2 signaling
	is influenced by both the stochastic dynamics of {C}a$^{2+}$ ions
	in the dyad as well as the shape and relative positioning of dyad
	proteins. Results suggest the hypothesis that the relative placement
	and shape of the RyR2 proteins helps to "funnel" {C}a$^{2+}$ ions

	vast com-

	putational resources. Finite-element techniques employing goal-oriented
	hp-adaptation

	strategies could offer a substantial improvement in the efficiency
	of such simulations.

	These strategies rely on dual-based a-posteriori error estimates for
	quantities of interest.

	However, the free-boundary character of fluid-structure-interaction
	problems forms a fun-

	damental complication, as it yields the underlying domain unknown
	a-priori. Instead, the

	domain comprises part of the solution. Consequently, the well-established
	generic frame-

	work for dual-based error estimation is not applicable.

	In this work we develop a framework for dual-based a-posteriori error
	estimation for

	free-boundary problems such as fluid-structure interaction. The framework
	is based on the

	embedded-domain approach and an extension operator which enables the
	comparison of

	approximate solutions on distinct domains. Given an approximate fluid
	and structure so-

	lution, we present a dual problem on the corresponding approximate
	fluid domain. Finally,

	we employ the dual solution to present an exact error representation
	formula.},
