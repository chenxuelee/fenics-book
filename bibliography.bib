	of
	
	the accuracy of approximations to solutions of elliptic partial differential
	equa-
	
	tions. It is shown that, by solving appropriate local residual type
	problems, one can
	
	obtain upper bounds on the error in the energy norm. Moreover, in
	the special case
	
	of adaptive h-p finite element analysis, the estimator will also give
	a realistic
	
	estimate of the error. A key feature of this is the development of
	a systematic
	
	approach to the determination of boundary conditions for the local
	problems. The
	
	work extends and combines several existing methods to the case of
	full h-p finite
	
	element approximation on possibly irregular meshes with elements of
	non-uniform
	
	degree. As a special case, the analysis proves a conjecture made by

	 Numerical linear algebra, particularly the solution of linear systems
	of equations, linear least squares problems, eigenvalue problems
	and singular value problems, is fundamental to most calculations
	in scientific computing, and is often the computationally intense
	part of such calculations. Designers of computer programs involving
	linear algebraic operations have frequently chosen to implement certain
	low level operations, such as the dot product or the matrix vector
	product, as separate subprograms. This may be observed both in many
	published codes and in codes written for specific applications at
	many computer installations.\par

	algebra libraries (both public domain and commercial) to interoperate

  abstract = {If the first task in numerical analysis is the calculation of an approximate
	solution,
	
	the second is to provide a guaranteed error bound and is often of
	equal importance. The standard
	
	approaches in the a posteriori error analysis of finite element methods
	suppose that the exact solution
	
	has a certain regularity or the numerical scheme enjoys some saturation
	property. For coarse meshes
	
	those asymptotic arguments are difficult to recast into rigorous error
	bounds. The aim of this paper
	
	is to provide reliable computable error bounds which are efficient
	and complete in the sense that
	
	constants are estimated as well. The main argument is a localization
	via a partition of unity which
	
	leads to problems on small domains. Two fully reliable estimates are
	established: The sharper
	
	one solves an analytical interface problem with residuals following
	Babuˇka and Rheinboldt [SIAM
	
	 s
	
	J. Numer. Anal., 15 (1978), pp. 736–754]. The second estimate is a
	modification of the standard
	
	residual-based a posteriori estimate with explicit constants from
	local analytical eigenvalue problems.
	
	For some class of triangulations we show that the efficiency constant
	is smaller than 2.5. According
	
	to our numerical experience, the overestimation of our computable
	estimates proved to be reasonably
	
	small, with an overestimation by a factor between 2.5 and 4 only.},

	as the product of two rectangular matrices with a strong block structure
	which makes their computation very easy. We show and comment an implementation
	of this algorithm in Matlab. Two numerical experiments, an interpolation

	Based on Eulerian and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Variational Formulations}},
  school = {Universit{\"a}tsbibliothek},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Aim of this work is the examination of numerical methods for fluid-structure
	interaction
	
	(FSI) problems. We use two approaches for the modelling of FSI problems.
	The well-known
	
	?arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian? (ALE) approach as well as an unusual
	fully Eulerian approach. For both frameworks we derive a general
	variational
	
	framework for the adaptive finite element approximation of FSI problems.
	
	The focal points of this thesis are the comparison of the ALE and
	the novel Eulerian approaches
	
	and the application of the ?dual weighted residual? (DWR) method to
	FSI problems.
	
	The DWR method is the basis of two techniques, a posteriori error
	estimation and
	
	goal-oriented mesh adaptivity.
	
	Based on the developed models of FSI we apply the DWR method for a
	posteriori error
	
	estimation and goal-oriented mesh adaptation to FSI problems. Necessary
	aspects of DWR
	
	method and implementation for the ALE and Eulerian approach are discussed.Several
	stationary as well as nonstationary examples are presented using
	both the ALE as
	
	well as the Eulerian framework. Results from both frameworks are in
	good agreement with
	
	each other. Also for both frameworks the DWR method is successfully
	applied.
	
	Finally using benchmark results from the DFG joint research group
	FOR 493 (of which the
	
	author is a participating member) the discussed methods are verified
	for both frameworks.},

	addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these

	development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting
	interoperability of independently developed software. \par Trilinos
	uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of
	packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed
	by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as
	algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist
	underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel,
	including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.
	\par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our
	use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations.
	We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package
	and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate
	how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally,
	we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering
	practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of a posteriori error estimators
	for convection-diffusion equations. The study involves the
	
	gradient indicator, an a posteriori error estimator which is based
	on gradient recovery, three residual-based error estimators for
	
	different norms, and two error estimators which are defined by solutions
	of local Neumann problems. They are compared with respect
	
	to the reliable estimation of the global error and with respect to
	the accuracy of the computed solutions on adaptively refined grids.
	The
	
	numerical study shows for both criteria of comparison that none of
	the considered error estimators works satisfactorily in all
	
	tests.},

  abstract = {The finite element method can be viewed as a machine that automates
	the discretization of differential
	
	equations, taking as input a variational problem, a finite element
	and a mesh, and producing as output
	
	a system of discrete equations. However, the generality of the framework
	provided by the finite element
	
	method is seldom reflected in implementations (realizations), which
	are often specialized and can handle
	
	only a small set of variational problems and finite elements (but
	are typically parametrized over the choice
	
	of mesh).
	
	This paper reviews ongoing research in the direction of a complete
	automation of the finite element method.
	
	In particular, this work discusses algorithms for the efficient and
	automatic computation of a system of
	
	discrete equations from a given variational problem, finite element
	and mesh. It is demonstrated that by
	
	automatically generating and compiling efficient low-level code, it
	is possible to parametrize a finite element
	
	code over variational problem and finite element in addition to the
	mesh.},

  abstract = {Why anisotropy? The straightforward answer to this question could
	be: because anisotropy is everywhere! Actually, when numerically
	solving a problem in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), or in some
	other areas, there are many instances where the solution shows directional
	features such as great variations along certain directions with less
	significant changes along other ones, e.g. boundary and internal
	layers, singularities or shocks. A correct orientation and deformation
	of the mesh elements (longest edges parallel to, e.g. the boundary
	layers) yields a great reduction of the number of triangles. Moreover,
	in the anisotropic case the layers are captured more sharply. The
	leitmotiv of an anisotropic analysis can be stated as: for a fixed
	solution accuracy, reduced the number of degrees of freedom involved
	in the approximation of the problem at hand by better orienting the
	mesh elements according to some suitable features of the solution,
	or vice versa, given a contraint on the number of elements, find
	the mesh maximizing the accuracy of the numerical solution. However,
	things may not be so straightforward. While anisotropy is proved
	to superior in terms of effectiveness for the most accurate computations
	in many cases, yet, there are some instances where a structured Adaptive
	Mesh Refinement (AMR) procedure turns out to be more simple to carry
	out, especially in view of an implementation in a parallel environment.
	Moreover, in the unstructured case, the main drawback of the anisotropic
	approach compared to the anisotropic one, is the more complex analysis
	required to fully describe the element dimensions and orientation.
	Though, this heavier burden is the strenght of the method. The outline
	of the article is the following. In the Sect. 2 we introduce the
	anisotropic framework by recalling some anisotropic interpolation
	error estimates, representing the main tool used in the a posteriori
	error analysis addressed in Sect. 3. This analysis is discussed in
	the case of a general differential operator, moving from the adjoint
	theory for goal-oriented error control, and it is then detailed for
	the advection-diffusion-reaction and the Stokes problems. Finally,
	in Sect. 4 the effectiveness of the anisotropic philosophy is assessed
	on some numerical test cases.},

	In
	
	the present paper, we prove the reliability of that error estimator
	on Lips-
	
	chitz domains. The key is to establish new error estimates for the
	commuting
	
	quasi-interpolation operators recently introduced in J. Schöberl,
	Commuting
	
	quasi-interpolation operators for mixed finite elements. Similar estimates
	are
	
	required for additive Schwarz preconditioning. To incorporate boundary
	con-
	
	ditions, we establish a new extension result.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of fluid-structure interaction typically require
	vast com-
	
	putational resources. Finite-element techniques employing goal-oriented
	hp-adaptation
	
	strategies could offer a substantial improvement in the efficiency
	of such simulations.
	
	These strategies rely on dual-based a-posteriori error estimates for
	quantities of interest.
	
	However, the free-boundary character of fluid-structure-interaction
	problems forms a fun-
	
	damental complication, as it yields the underlying domain unknown
	a-priori. Instead, the
	
	domain comprises part of the solution. Consequently, the well-established
	generic frame-
	
	work for dual-based error estimation is not applicable.
	
	 In this work we develop a framework for dual-based a-posteriori error
	estimation for
	
	free-boundary problems such as fluid-structure interaction. The framework
	is based on the
	
	embedded-domain approach and an extension operator which enables the
	comparison of
	
	approximate solutions on distinct domains. Given an approximate fluid
	and structure so-
	
	lution, we present a dual problem on the corresponding approximate
	fluid domain. Finally,
	
	we employ the dual solution to present an exact error representation
