The FEniCS project aims towards the goals of generality, efficiency,
and simplicity, concerning mathematical methodology, implementation
and application, and the Unicorn project is an implementation aimed at
FSI and high Re turbulent flow guided by these principles. Unicorn is
based on the DOLFIN/FFC/FIAT suite and the linear algebra package
PETSc. We here present some key elements of Unicorn, and a set of
computational results from applications. The details of the Unicorn
implementation are described in Chapter~\ref{chap:hoffman-2}.

\section{Background}
For many problems involving a fluid and a structure, decoupling the
computation of the two is not feasible for accurate modeling of the
phenomenon at hand. Instead, the full fluid--structure interaction (FSI)
problem has to be solved together as a coupled problem. This includes a
multitude of important problems in biology, medicine and industry, such
as the simulation of insect or bird flight, the human cardiovascular
and respiratory systems, the human speech organ, the paper making
process, acoustic noise generation in exhaust systems, airplane wing
flutter, wind induced vibrations in bridges and wave loads on offshore
structures. Common for many of these problems is that for various reasons
they are very hard or impossible to investigate experimentally, and thus
reliable computational simulation would open up for detailed study and
new insights, as well as for new important design tools for construction.

Computational methods for FSI is a very active research field today. In
particular, major open challenges of computational FSI include: (i)
robustness of the fluid--structure coupling, (ii) for high Reynolds
numbers (Re) the computation of turbulent fluid flow, and (iii) efficiency
and reliability of the computations in the form of adaptive methods and
quantitative error estimation.

\section{Simulation of high Re turbulent flow}

The focus of Unicorn is high Re turbulent fluid flow, also including
fluid--structure interaction. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of
turbulent flow is limited to moderate Re and simple geometry, due to
the high computational cost of resolving all turbulent scales in the
flow. The standard approach in the automotive industry is simulation
based on Reynolds averaged Navier--Stokes equations (RANS), where time
averages (or statistical averages) are computed to an affordable cost,
with the drawback of introducing turbulence models based on parameters
that have to be tuned for particular applications.

An alternative to DNS and RANS is Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
\citep{Sagaut2005}, where a filter is applied to the Navier--Stokes
equations to derive a new set of equations with a smallest scale given by
the filter width, and where the effect of the filter is the introduction
of so called subgrid stresses which need to be modeled in a subgrid
model. A subgrid model can be motivated by physics theory or experiments,
and the main effect of the subgrid model is to dissipate kinetic energy,
for example in the form of turbulent viscosity.

Typically, the numerical method used to approximate the LES equations also
introduces dissipation, and there are thus two sources of kinetic energy
dissipation: the subgrid model and the numerical method. One class of
methods, Implicit LES (ILES), relies completely on the numerical method
to act as a subgrid model, without any additional explicit subgrid model
\citep{Sagaut2005}. Turbulence simulation in Unicorn is based on ILES
in the form a stabilized finite element method, referred to as a
General Galerkin (G2) simulation \citep{HoffmanJohnson2007}, where a
least squares stabilization based on the residual of the
Navier--Stokes equations acts as an ILES subgrid model.

In the current G2/ILES implementation of Unicorn, continuous piecewise
linear approximation is used in space and time, together with a least
squares stabilization based on the residual;
see \citet{HoffmanJohnson2007} for details.

\section{Turbulent boundary layers}
\label{hoffman-1:section:blayer}

The choice of boundary conditions at a solid wall is critical for
accurate LES modeling of fluid flow, in particular to capture flow
separation phenomena. In Unicorn, laminar boundary layers are fully
resolved by the computational method by applying no slip (zero
velocity) boundary conditions at the wall. On the other hand,
computational resolution of turbulent boundary layers is only possible
at limited Reynolds numbers and for simple geometries.

The standard way to model the effect of turbulent boundary layers is
to divide the computational domain into: (i) an interior part and (ii)
a boundary layer region. In the boundary layer, a simplified model of
the flow is used to provide boundary conditions to the LES equations
to be solved in the interior part. Boundary conditions are typically
in the form of a wall shear stress, and the coupling between (i) and
(ii) may be one-way from (ii) to (i), or more closely coupled. Wall
shear stress models are developed based on experimental data, theory
or computation by a simplified model such as, e.g., a RANS model. For
an overview of boundary layer modeling,
see \citet{SagautDeckTerracol2006,PiomelliBalaras2002}.

The wall shear stress model in Unicorn takes a similar form as the
simple Schumann model \citep{Schumann1975}, with the tangential
velocity proportional to the local wall shear stress through a skin
friction parameter (or function) $\beta$. The following boundary
conditions are used for the velocity $u$ and stress $\sigma$:
\begin{align}
u\cdot n &= 0, \label{hoffman-1:slfra} \\
\beta u\cdot \tau_k + (\sigma n) \cdot \tau_k &= 0, \quad k=1,2, \label{hoffman-1:slfrb}
\end{align}
for $(x,t)\in \Gamma_{solid}\times [0,T]$, with $n=n(x)$ an outward
unit normal vector, and $\tau_k=\tau_k(x)$ orthogonal unit tangent vectors
of $\Gamma_{solid}$. The non-penetration boundary condition is applied
strongly, whereas a weak implementation is used for the wall shear
stress boundary condition.

\section{Adaptivity and a~posteriori error estimation}

A~posteriori error estimation involves only computable quantities,
which opens for adaptive methods with quantitative error control. The
basic idea of adaptive algorithms is to optimize the computational
method with respect to the goal (output of interest) of the
computation. Typical parameters of an adaptive finite element method
include the local mesh size ($h$-adaptivity), local degree of the
finite element approximation ($p$-adaptivity), local shape of the
cells ($r$-adaptivity), or combinations thereof. Other possible
parameters may be the time step size and the stabilization parameters.

In Unicorn, an approach to a~posteriori error estimation is used where
the error in a chosen output quantity can be estimated in terms of the
solution of an associated linearized dual problem. The basic framework
is described in the survey articles
\citep{ErikssonEstepEtAl1995,BeckerRannacher2001,GilesSuli2002}.

Using standard techniques of a~posteriori error analysis, an
a~posteriori error estimate for G2 can be derived in the following
form:
\begin{equation}
\vert \mathcal{M}(u) - \mathcal{M}(U) \vert \leqslant \sum_T \eta_T,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{M}(u)$ is the exact value of the target output
quantity and $\mathcal{M}(U)$ is the computed
approximation. Furthermore, $U$ is a G2 solution and $\eta_T$ is a
local error indicator for cell $T$. The error indicator $\eta_T$ is
constructed from the residual, measuring local errors, weighted by the
solution to a dual (adjoint) problem measuring the effect of local
errors on the output $\mathcal{M}(\cdot)$. The implementation of the
dual problem in Unicorn is based on the \cgone{}\cgone{} method
described in \citet{HoffmanJohnson2007}. The computational mesh is
then modified according to $\eta_T$, by mesh refinement, coarsening or
smoothing.

Adaptive G2 methods (also referred to as adaptive DNS/LES) have been
used in a number of turbulent flow computations to a very low
computational cost where convergence is obtained for output quantities
such as drag, lift and pressure coefficients and Strouhal numbers,
using orders of magnitude fewer numbers of mesh points than with LES
methods based on \emph{ad hoc} refined computational meshes found in
the literature
\citep{Hoffman2005,HoffmanJohnson2006b,Hoffman2006,Hoffman2009,HoffmanJansson2009,VilelaJanssonEtAl2010}.

\section{Robust fluid--structure coupling}

In a computational method based on so called weakly coupled FSI,
separate solvers can be used for the fluid and the structure, with the
benefit of being able to reuse existing dedicated fluid and structure
solvers. To couple the fluid and the structure, boundary data such as
displacements and stresses are exchanged over the fluid--structure
interface. To make the coupling more robust, the equations for the
fluid and the structure can be placed in the same algebraic system
together with all coupling conditions, corresponding to a so called
strong FSI coupling.

Another approach is to formulate the fluid and the structure as one
single continuum model, which is then said to be a monolithic FSI
method. The monolithic method used in Unicorn is referred to as
Unified Continuum FSI (UC-FSI) \citep{HoffmanJanssonStockli2011},
where the fluid and the structure are discretized by the same finite
element method over the combined fluid--structure continuum. A
velocity formulation is used for the structure to make it consistent
with the corresponding fluid equations, and the FSI problem thus takes
the form of a multiphase flow problem, with the two phases, the fluid
and the structure, described by different constitutive laws. In
particular, coupling conditions for displacements and stresses are
directly satisfied when using a continuous finite element
discretization, which makes UC-FSI very robust.

The computational mesh is made to follow the deformation of the
structure, and in the fluid part mesh smoothing is used to optimize
the mesh quality, corresponding to an ALE method for the combined
fluid--structure continuum. In Unicorn, UC-FSI is implemented based
on a continuous piecewise linear approximation in space and time, and
a simple streamline diffusion stabilization is used, similar to the
method in \citet{Hansbo2000}. See \citet{HoffmanJanssonStockli2011}
for details on the method.

\section{Applications}

In this section, the capability of the Unicorn solver is illustrated
by a set of simulation results, connecting to the main focus described
above of high Re turbulent flow and robust fluid--structure
interaction. Quantitative results are presented for benchmark problems
of turbulent flow and FSI, and qualitative results for a turbulent
flow FSI problem is presented where no reference data is available. A
sensitivity study is also presented, where the skin friction parameter
of the boundary layer model is varied to observe the effect on flow
separation.

\subsection{High Re turbulent flow}

We first consider the benchmark problem to compute a time average of
the drag force on a cube. Starting from a very coarse tetrahedral mesh
with 17,952 vertices, the mesh is adaptively refined 17 times, in each
iteration marking 10\% of the tetrahedrons in the mesh for refinement
by bisection. In Figure~\ref{hoffman-1:fig:cube1}, the corresponding drag
coefficient is shown as the mesh is refined, converging to a value of
$c_D\approx 1.25\pm 5\%$ over the time interval chosen in the
computation. Computing the drag coefficient over a longer time
interval would give better confidence in the mean value, at a higher
computational cost. In \citet{Mccormick1995}, an interval of $1.0-1.2$
is given for the drag coefficient $c_D$, although the detailed setup
of the underlying experiments is not clear. We note that for this
case, when flow separation is given by the sharp corners of the
geometry, $c_D$ is considered independent of the specific (high)
Reynolds number \citep{Mccormick1995}. We conclude that the Unicorn
results are consistent with experimental findings.

In Figure~\ref{hoffman-1:fig:cube2}, snapshots of the solution are shown for the
adaptively refined mesh. In Figure~\ref{hoffman-1:fig:cube3}, a snapshot of the
gradient of the dual solution is shown which provides sensitivity
information with respect to the computation of drag force. Where this
gradient is large, the local computational error (local residual
weighted by local mesh size) must be made small by refining the mesh,
since the error in drag is given by the product of the gradient of the
dual solution and local errors. I Figure~\ref{hoffman-1:fig:cube3}, a snapshot
of such a local error is shown, where we note that this local error is
reduced where the gradient of the dual solution is large but left
large in other areas.

Two main features of the adaptive method are: (i) a converged
approximation of the drag coefficient $c_D$ (within 5\%) is obtained
using very few degrees of freedom, and (ii) the mesh is automatically
constructed from a coarse mesh, thus bypassing the cost and challenge
of ad~hoc mesh design. A full discussion of these computations is
available in \citet{HoffmanJansson2011}.

\subsection{Turbulent flow separation}

In Unicorn, the effect of turbulent boundary layers is modeled by a
skin friction wall shear stress model, described above. This model has
one parameter $\beta$, which is related to the skin friction stress.
Higher Reynolds number is modeled by a smaller $\beta$, based on
experimental observation that the skin friction (coefficient)
decreases with increasing $Re$.

To estimate the dependence of the computational result on $\beta$, a
computational study is carried out using Unicorn, where the drag force
of a circular cylinder is computed adaptively based on a~posteriori
error estimation; see \citet{HoffmanJansson2009} for details. In
particular, the phenomenon of drag crisis is targeted, characterized
by a sudden drop in the non-dimensional drag coefficient for a
cylinder for $Re$ increasing beyond a critical size of about
$10^5$. By decreasing the skin friction parameter $\beta$, modeling an
increasing $Re$, the drag crisis scenario is reproduced using Unicorn,
in agreement with the high $Re$ experimental data available in the
literature \citep{Zdravkovich2003}. In particular, the drag
coefficient drops to a level found in experiments after drag crisis,
and 3D so called cell structures develop in the form of streamwise
vorticity, also reported in the literature \citep{Zdravkovich2003}.
For vanishing skin friction, the flow approaches a state independent
of the skin friction parameter, corresponding to a free slip boundary
condition, see Figures~\ref{hoffman-1:fig:1}-\ref{hoffman-1:fig:3}. Although
controversial, this suggests a dominant inviscid separation mechanism
independent of the boundary layer, investigated further in
\citet{HoffmanJohnson2008b,HoffmanJansson2009}.

\subsection{Turbulent flow past complex geometry}

With the parallel implementation of Unicorn, realistic problems of
complex geometry and high Re turbulent flow can be addressed. As an
example, we present simulation results from the NASA/AIAA workshop
``Benchmark problems for Airframe Noise Computations'' (BANC-1), held
in conjunction with the 16$^{th}$ AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference
in Stockholm in 2010, where Unicorn was used for adaptive simulation
of flow past a rudimentary landing gear configuration
\citep{VilelaJanssonEtAl2010}. The landing gear configuration was
designed by Boeing, and detailed experimental results were available,
as well as comparison with other participating groups
\citep{SpalartMejia2011}.

Starting from a coarse mesh of ca. 70,000 mesh points, the mesh was
adaptively refined 7 times with respect to the error in the drag force
on the landing gear. The resulting final mesh had 1,000,000 mesh
points, and the computation ran on the \textit{Akka} computer at HPC2N
using 264~cores. The skin friction boundary layer model was used with
$\beta=0$, thus corresponding to a slip boundary condition.

The Unicorn contribution to the workshop compared well with other
participating groups, with overall little spread in the computation
of aerodynamic forces, and mean sound pressure levels. Furthermore, mean flow
patterns on the surface of the landing gear (see Figure~\ref{hoffman-1:rlg})
showed good agreement with experimental results. Other quantities, such
as frequencies, showed a wide spread among the participating groups.

Thanks to the adaptive mesh refinement and the cheap boundary layer
model, the Unicorn results were obtained with very few mesh points,
less than all other participating groups in the workshop, see Table
\ref{hoffman-1:tab:hoffman-1-rlg}.

\subsection{Robust fluid--structure interaction}

As a quantitative test of the Unicorn FSI solver, we consider
the benchmark problem FLUSTRUK-A, variant 3, which is defined in
\citet{HronTurek2005}. This is a 2D flow in a channel past a fixed
cylinder with a thin flexible bar attached to the downstream side of the
cylinder. The Unicorn results are compared to the reference results of
two other groups: \citet{HronTurek2005} and \citet{DunneRannacher2006}.

The $y$-displacement in the oscillation regime varies between 0.0353m
and -0.0332m (see Figure~\ref{hoffman-1:fig:flustruk}), which is within 1-2\% of
the Hron/Turek results, and within 11\% of the Dunne/Rannacher
amplitude. The oscillation frequency is estimated to 5.3Hz from the
graph. For comparison, the Hron/Turek frequency is estimated to 5.4Hz
and the Dunne/Rannacher frequency is given as 5.48 Hz. See
\citet{HoffmanJanssonStockli2011} for a full discussion of the
results, where also additional basic benchmark results are presented.

  \label{hoffman-1:fig:flustruk}
\end{figure}

Unicorn targets large structure deformations\vadjust{\pagebreak} interacting with turbulent
fluid flow. In Figure~\ref{hoffman-1:fig:flag}, we present qualitative results for
a model problem of a flexible structure interacting with turbulent flow
in 3D, in the form of a fixed cube in turbulent flow with a thin flexible
flag mounted in the downstream wake.

We choose an inflow speed of 100~m/s, a cube side length of 1~cm and a
flag mounted at the top of the back face of the cube with a length of
0.3~m and a thickness of 5~cm. The viscosity of the fluid is
100~$\mu$~Pa~s (density $\rho=1$) which gives a representative
Reynold's number of size $\mathrm{Re} = 10^5$. We choose no-slip
boundary conditions on the cube and flag with slip boundary conditions
on the surrounding channel walls, and a zero pressure outflow
condition.

Violent bending and torsion motion in the direction of the long axis
of the flag are observed, and we note that the method is robust for
these large structure deformations and highly fluctuating flow.
