Heart failure is one of the most common causes of death in the western
world, and it is therefore of great importance to understand the
behaviour of the heart better, with the ultimate goal to improve
clinical procedures. The heart is a complicated electro-mechanical
pump, and modelling its mechanical behaviour requires multiscale
physics incorporating coupled electro-chemical and mechanical models
both at the cell and continuum level.  In this chapter we present a
basic implementation of a cardiac electromechanics simulator in the
FEniCS framework.
