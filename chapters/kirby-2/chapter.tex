The linear algebraic theory for constructing finite element basis
functions lends itself nicely to numerical implementation.  The FIAT
project makes use of several tools to efficiently construct and
evaluate general finite element bases.  This chapter will summarize
the implementation of the FIAT project, including polynomials,
representation of the finite element linear functionals as vectors,
and use of the singular value decomposition to carve out new function
spaces.  Besides generality, the two key themes are numerical
stability/accuracy via orthogonal polynomials and efficiency through
dense linear algebra.
