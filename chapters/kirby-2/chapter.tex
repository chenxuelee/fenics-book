\section{Introduction}
The FIAT project~\cite{Kir04,Kir06} implements the mathematical framework
described in Chapter~\ref{} as a Python package, working mainly in
terms of numerical linear algebra.  Although an implementation
floating-point arithmetic presents some challenges relative to
symbolic computation, it can allow greater efficiency and consume
fewer resources, especially for high order
elements.  To obtain efficiency in Python, the compute-intensive
operations are expressed in terms of numerical linear algebra and
performed using the widely distributed \texttt{numpy} package.

The FIAT project is one of the first FEniCS projects, providing the
basis function back-end for \texttt{ffc} and enabling high-order 
\( H^1 \), 
\( H(\mathrm{div}) \) and \( H(\mathrm{curl}) \) elements.  It is widely
distributed, with downloads on every inhabited continent and in over
sixty countries, averaging  about 100 downloads per month. 


This chapter works in the context of a Ciarlet triple \( (K,P,N) \)~\cite{Cia78},
where \( K \) is a fixed reference domain, typically a triangle or
tetrahedron.  \( P \) is a finite-dimensional polynomial space, though
perhaps vector- or tensor-valued and not coincident with polynomials
of some fixed degree.  \( N = \{ \ell_i \}_{i=1}^{|P|} \) is a set of linear functionals spanning
\( P^\prime \).  Recalling Chapter~\cite{}, the goal is first to
enumerate a convenient basis \( \{ \phi_i \}_{i=1}^{|P|} \) for \( P
\) and then to form a generalized Vandermonde system
\[
V A = I,
\]
where \( V_{ij} = \ell_i( \phi_j) \).
The columns of \( A = V^{-1} \) store the expansion coefficients of
the nodal basis for \( (K,P,N) \) in terms of the basis \( \{ \phi_i
\} \).


\section{Prime basis: Collapsed-coordinate polynomials}
High order polynomials in floating-point arithmetic require stable
evaluation algorithms.  FIAT uses the so-called collapsed-coordinate
polynomials~\cite{KarShe99} on the triangle and tetrahedra.  Let
\(P^{\alpha,\beta}_i(x) \) denote the Jacobi polynomial of degree \( i
\) with weights \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \).
On the triangle \( K \) 
with vertices \( (-1,1) \), \((1,-1) \), \( (-1,1) \), the
polynomials are of the form 
\[
  D^{p,q}( x,y ) = P^{0,0}_{p}(\eta_1)  \left( \frac{1-\eta_2}{2}
  \right)^i P^{2i+1,0}_j(\eta_2)
\]
where
\[
\begin{split}
\eta_1 & = 2\left( \frac{1+x}{1-y} \right) - 1\\
\eta_2 & = y
\end{split}
\]
is called the collapsed-coordinate mapping is a singular
transformation between the triangle and the biunit 
square.  The set \( \{ D^{p,q}( x,y) \}_{p,q \geq 0}^{p+q\leq n} \)
forms a basis for polynomoials of degree \( n \).  Moreover, they are
orthogonal in the \( L^2(K) \) inner product.
Recently~\cite{Kir09}, it has been shown that these polynomials
may be computed directly on the triangle without reference to the
singular mapping.  This means that no special treatment of the
singular point is required, allowing use of standard automatic
differentiation techniques to compute derivatives.  

The recurrences are obtained by rewriting the polynomials as
\[
D^{p,q}(x,y) = \chi^{p}(x,y) \psi^{p,q}(y),
\]
where \[
 \chi^{p}(x,y) = P^{0,0}_p(\eta_1) \left( \frac{1-\eta_2}{2}
\right)^p
\]
and
\[
\psi^{p,q}(y) = P^{2p+1,0}_q(\eta_2) = P^{2p+1,0}_q(y).
\]
This representation is not separable in \( \eta_1 \) and \( \eta_2 \),
which may seem to be a drawback to readers familiar with the usage of
these polynomials in spectral methods.  However, they do still admit
sum-factorization techniques.  More importantly for present purposes,
each \( \chi^p \) is in fact a polynomial in \( x \) and \( y \) and
may be computed by recurrence.  \( \psi^{p,q} \) is just a Jacobi
polynomial in \( y \) and so has a well-known three-term recurrence.
The recurrences derived in~\cite{Kir09} are presented in Algorithm~\ref{dubalg}
\begin{algorithm}

\end{algorithm}


\section{Representing polynomials and functionals}
Even using recurrence relations and \texttt{numpy} vectorization for
arithmetic, further care is required to optimize performance.  In this
section, standard 
operations on polynomials will be translated into vector operations, and
then batches of such operations cast as matrix multiplication.  This
helps eliminate the interpretive overhead of Python while moving
numerical computation into  optimized library routines, since 
\texttt{numpy.dot} wraps level 3 BLAS and other functions such as
\texttt{numpy.svd} wrap relevant LAPACK routines.

Since polynomials and
functionals over polynomials both form vector spaces, it is natural
to represent each of them as vectors representing expansion
coefficients in some basis.  So, let \( \{ \phi_i \} \) be the set of
polynomials described above.

Now, any \( p \in P \) is written as a linear combination of the basis
functions \( \{ \phi_i \} \).  Introduce a mapping \( \mathcal{R} \)
from \( P \) into \( \mathbb{R}^{|P|} \) by taking the expansion
coefficients of \( p \) in terms of \( \{ \phi_i \} \).  That is,
\[
p = \mathcal{R}(p)_i \phi_i,
\]
where summation is implied over \( i \).

A polynomial \( p \) may then be evaluated at a point \( x \) as
follows.  Let \( \Phi_i \) be the basis functions tabulated at \( x
\).  That is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bigphi}
\Phi_i = \phi_i(x).
\end{equation}
Then, evaluating \( p \) follows by a simple dot product:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:doteval}
p(x) = \mathcal{R}(p)_i \Phi_i.
\end{equation}

More generally in FIAT, a set of polynomials \( \{ p_i \} \) will need
to be evaulated simultaneously, such as evaluating all of the members
of a finite element basis.  
The coefficients of the set of
polynomials may be stored in the rows of a matrix \( C \), so
that
\[
C_{ij} = \mathcal{R}(p_i)_j.
\]
Tabulating this entire set of polynomials at a point \( x \) is simply
obtained by matrix-vector multiplication.  Let \( \Phi_i \) be as
in~(\ref{eq:bigphi}).  Then,
\[
p_i(x) = C_{ij} \Phi_j.
\]

The basis functions are typically needed at a set of points, such as
those of a quadrature rule.  Let \( \{
x_j \} \) now be a collection of points in \( K \) and let
\[
\Phi_{ij} = \phi_i(x_j),
\]
where the rows of \( \Phi \) run over the basis functions and the
columns over the collection of points.  As before, the set of
polynomials may be tabulated at all the points by
\[
p_i(x_j) = C_{ik} \Phi_{kj},
\]
which is just the matrix product \( C \Phi \) and may
may be efficiently carried out by a library operation,
such as the \texttt{numpy.dot} wrapper to level 3 BLAS.

Finite element computation also requires the evaluation of derivatives 
of polynomials.  In a symbolic context, differentiation presents no
particular difficulty, but working in a numerical context requires
some special care.

For some differential operator \( D \), the derivatives
\( D \phi_i \) are computed at apoint \( x \), any polynomial
\( p = \mathcal{R}(p)_i \phi_i \) may be differentiated at \( x \) by
\[
Dp(x) = \mathcal{R}(p)_i (D\phi_i),
\]
which is exactly analagous to~(\ref{eq:doteval}).  By analogy, sets of
polynomials may be differentiated at sets of points just like
evaluation.

The formulae in Algorithm~\ref{dubalg} and their tetrahedral counterpart are
fairly easy to differentiate, but derivatives may also be obtained through
automatic differentiation.  Some experimental support for this using
the AD tools in Scientific Python has been developed in an unreleased
version of FIAT.  

The released version of FIAT currently evaluates derivatives in terms
of linear operators, which allows the coordinate singularity in the
standard recurrence relations to be avoided.  For each Cartesian
partial derivative \( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k} \), a matrix \(
D^k \) is calculated such that
\[
\mathcal{R}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_k}\right)_i
= D^k_{ij} \mathcal{R}(p)_j.
\]
Then, derivatives of sets of polynomials may be tabulated by
premultiplying the coefficient matrix \( C \) with such a \( D^k \) matrix.

This paradigm may also be extended to vector- and tensor-valued
polynomials, making use of the multidimensional arrays implemented in
\texttt{numpy}.  Let \( P \) be a space of scalar-valued polynomials and
\( n > 0 \) an integer.  Then, a member of \( (P)^m \), a vector with
\( m \) components in \( P \), may be represented as a two-dimensional
array.  Let \( p \in (P)^m \) and \( p^i \) be the \( j^\mathrm{th} \)
component of \( p \).  Then \( p = \mathcal{R}(p)_{jk} \phi_k \), so
that \( \mathcal{R}(p)_{jk} \) is the coefficient of \( \phi_k \) for
\( p^j \).  

The previous discussion of tabulating collections of functions at
collections of points is naturally extended to this context.  If \( \{
p_i \} \) is a set of members of \( P^m \), then their coefficients
may be stored in an array \( C_{ijk} \), where \( C_i \) is the
two-dimensional array \( \mathcal{R}(p)_{jk} \) of coefficients for \(
p_i \).  As before, \( \Phi_{ij} = \phi_i(x_j) \) contains the of
basis functions at a set of points.  Then, the \( j^\mathrm{th} \)
component of \( v_i \) at the point \( x_k \) is naturally given by a
three-dimensional array
\[
p_i(x_k)^j = C_{ijl} \phi_{lk}.
\]
Psychologically, this is just a matrix product if \( C_{ijl} \)
is stored contiguously in generalized row-major format, and the
operation is readly cast as dense matrix multiplication.  

Returning for the moment to scalar-valued polynomials, linear
functionals may also be represented as 
Euclidean vectors.  Let \( \ell: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be a linear
functional.  Then, for any \( p \in P \), 
\[
\ell( p ) = \ell( \mathcal{R}(p)_i \phi_i )
= \mathcal{R}(p)_i \ell( \phi_i ),
\]
so that \( \ell \) acting on \( p \) is determined entirely by its
action on the basis \( \{ \phi_i \} \).  As with \( \mathcal{R} \), define
\( \mathcal{R}^\prime : P^\prime \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{|P|} \) by
\[ 
  \mathcal{R}^\prime (\ell)_i
= \ell( \phi_i),
\]
so that
\[
\ell(p) = \mathcal{R}^\prime(\ell)_i\mathcal{R}(p)_i.
\]
Note that the inverse of \( \mathcal{R}^\prime \) is the Banach-space
adjoint of \( \mathcal{R} \).

Just as with evaluation, sets of linear functionals can be applied to
sets of functions via matrix multiplication.  Let \( \{ \ell_i
\}_{i=1}^N \subset P^\prime \) and \( \{ u_i \}_{i=1}^N \subset P \).
The functionals are represented by a matrix
\[
L_{ij} = \mathcal{R}^\prime(\ell_i)_j
\]
and the functions by
\[
C_{ij} = \mathcal{R}(u_i)_j
\]
Then, evaluating all of the functionals on all of the functions is
computed by the matrix product
\begin{equation}
A_{ij} = L_{ik}C_{jk},
\end{equation}
or \( A = L C^t \).  This is especially useful in the setting of the
next section, where the basis for the finite element spaceneeds to be
expressed as a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials.

Also, the formalism of \( \mathcal{R}^\prime \) may be generalized to
functionals over vector-valued spaces.  As before, let \( P \) be a
space of degree \( n \) with basis \( \{ \phi_i \}_{i=1}^{|P|} \) and
to each \( v \in (P)^m \) associate the representation \( v^i
= \mathcal{R}(v)_{ij}\phi_j \).  In this notation, 
\( v = \mathcal{R}(v)_{ij} \phi_j \) is the vector indexed over \( i \).
For any functional
\( \ell \in \left( \left(P\right)^m \right)^\prime \), a 
representation \( \mathcal{R}^\prime(\ell)_{ij} \) must be defined
such that 
\[
\ell(v) = \mathcal{R}^\prime(\ell)_{ij} \mathcal{R}(v)_{ij},
\]
with summation implied over \(i\) and \( j\).  To determine the
representation of \( \mathcal{R}^\prime(f) \), let \( e^j \) be the
canonical basis vector with \( (e^j)_i = \delta_{ij} \) and 
write
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\ell(v) & = \ell( \mathcal{R}_{ij}\phi_j ) \\
& = \ell( \mathcal{R}(v)_{ij} \delta_{ik} e^k \phi^j ) \\
& = \ell( \mathcal{R}(v)_{ij} e^i \phi_j ) \\
& = \mathcal{R}(v)_{ij} \ell( e^i \phi_j ).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From this, it is seen that \( \mathcal{R}^\prime(\ell)_{ij} = \ell(
e^i \phi_j ) \).

Now, let \( \{ v_i \}_{i=1}^N \) be a set of vector-valued polynomials
and \( \{ \ell_i \}_{i=1}^M \) a set of linear functionals acting on
them.  The polynomials may be stored by a coefficient tensor \(
C_{ijk} = \mathcal{R}(v_i)_{jk} \).  The functionals may be
represented by a tensor \( L_{ijk} = \mathcal{R}^\prime(\ell_i)_{jk}
\).  The matrix \( A_{ij} = \ell_i(v_j) \) is readily computed by the
contraction
\[
A_{ij} = L_{ikl} C_{jkl}.
\]
Despite having three indices, this calculation may still be performed by
matrix multiplication.  Since \texttt{numpy} stores arrays in row-major
format, a simple reshaping may be performed without data motion
so that \( A = \tilde{L} \tilde{C}^t \), for \( \tilde{L} \) and \(
\tilde{C} \) reshaped to two-dimensional arrays by combining the
second and third axes.



\section{Other polynomial spaces}
Many of the complicated elements that motivate the development of a
tool like FIAT polynomial spaces that are not polynomials of
some complete degree (or vectors or tensors of such).   Once
a process for providing bases for such spaces is described, the
techniques of the previous section may be applied directly.  Most
finite element polynomial spaces are described either by adding a few
basis functions to some polynomials of complete degree or else by
constraining such a space by some linear functionals.

\subsection{Supplemented polynomial spaces}
A classic example of the first case is the Raviart-Thomas element,
where the function space of order \(r \) is
\[
RT_r = \left( P_r(K) \right)^d \oplus \left( \tilde{P}_r(K) \right) x,
\]
where \( x \in \mathbb{R}^d \) is the coordinate vector and
\( \tilde{P}_r \) is the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree \(
r \).  
Given any basis \( \{ \phi_i \} \) for \( P_r(K) \) such as the
Dubiner basis, it is easy to obtain a basis for \( (P_r(K))^d \) by
taking vectors where one component is some \( \phi_i \) and the rest
are zero.  The issue is obtaining a basis for the entire space.

Consider the case \( d = 2 \) (triangles).  While monomials of the
form
\(
x^i y^{r-i}
\) span the space of homoegeneous
polynomials, they are subject to ill-conditioning in numerical computations.
On the other hand, the Dubiner basis 
of order \( r \), \( \{ \phi_i \}_{i=1}^{|P_r|} \) 
may be ordered so that the last \( r + 1 \) functions,
\( \{ \phi_i \}_{i=|P_r|-r}^{|P_r|} \), have degree exactly \( r \).
While they do not span \( \tilde{P}_r \), the span of 
\( \{ x \phi_i \}_{i=|P_r|-r}^{|P_r|} \) together with a basis for \(
(P_r(K))^2 \) does span \( RT_r \).

So, this gives a basis for the Raviart-Thomas space that can be
evaluated and differentiated using the recurrence relations described
above.  A similar technique may be used to construct elements that
consist of standard elements augmented with some kind of bubble
function, such as 
the PEERS element of elasticity or MINI element for Stokes flow.


\subsection{Constrained polynomial spaces}
An example of the second case is the Brezzi-Douglas-Fortin-Marini
element~\cite{BreFor91}.  Let \( \mathcal{E}(K) \) be the set of dimension one
cofacets of \( K \) (edges in 2d, faces in 3d).  Then the function
space is
\[
BDFM_r(K) = \{ u \in (P_r(K))^d : u\cdot n|_{\gamma} \in
P_{r-1}(\gamma), \, \, \, \gamma \in \mathcal{E}(K) \}
\]

This space is naturally interpreted as taking a function space,
\( (P_r(K))^d \), and imposing linear constraints.  For the case \( d
= 2 \), there are exactly three such constraints.  For \( \gamma
\in \mathcal{E}(K) \), let \( \mu^\gamma \) be the Legendre polynomial
of degree \( r \) mapped to \( \gamma \).  Then, if a function \( u
\in (P_r(K))^d \), it is in \( BDFM_r(K) \) iff
\[
\int_{\gamma} ( u \cdot n ) \mu^\gamma \, ds = 0
\]
for each \( \gamma \in \mathcal{E}(K) \).  

Number the edges by \( \{ \gamma_i \}_{i=1}^3 \) and introduce
linear functionals \\
\( \ell_i(u) = \int_{\gamma_i} (u \cdot n)
\mu^{\gamma_i} \, ds \).  Then,
\[
BDFM_r(K) = \cap_{i=1}^3 \mathrm{null}(\ell_i).
\]
This may naturally be cast into linear algebra and so evaluated with
LAPACK.  Following the
techniques for constructing Vandermonde matrices, a \emph{constraint
  matrix} may be constructed.  Let \( \{ \bar{\phi}_i \} \) be a basis
for \( (P_r(K))^2 \).  Define the \( 3 \times |(P_r)|^2 \) matrix
\[
C_{ij} = \ell_i( \phi_j ).
\]
Then, a basis for the null space of this matrix is constructed using
the singular value decomposition~\cite{GolVan96}.  The vectors of this
null-space basis are readily seen to contain the expansion
coefficients of a basis for \( BDFM_r \) in terms of a basis for
\( P_r(K)^2 \).  With this basis in hand,
the nodal basis for \( BDFM_r(K) \) is obtained by constructing the
generalized Vandermonde matrix.

This technique may be generalized to three dimensions, and it also
applies to N\'ed\'elec~\cite{Ned80}, Arnold-Winther~\cite{ArnWin02},
Mardal-Tai-Winther~\cite{MarTai02}, 
and many other elements.

\section{Conveying topological information to clients}
Most of this chapter has provided techniques for constructing finite
element bases and evaluating and differentiating them.  
FIAT must also indicate which degrees of freedom are
associated with which entities of the reference element.  This
information is required when local-global mappings are generated by a
form compiler such as \texttt{ffc}. 

The topological information is provided by a graded incidence relation
and is similar to the presentation of finite element meshes in~\cite{Log09}.  
Each entity in the reference element is
labeled by its topological dimension (e.g. 0 for vertices and 1 for
edges), and then the entities of the same dimension are ordered by
some convention.  To each entity, a list of the local nodes is
associated.  For example, the reference triangle with entities labeled
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reftri}, and the
cubic Lagrange triangle with nodes in the dual basis labeled is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p3}.  

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:reftri}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{chapters/kirby-2/eps/reftri.eps}
    \caption{The reference triangle, with vertices, edges, and the
      face numbered.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:p3}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{chapters/kirby-2/eps/P3.eps}
    \caption{The cubic Lagrange triangle, with nodes in the dual basis
      labelled.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

For this example, the graded incidence relation is stored as
\begin{verbatim}
{ 0: { 0: [ 0 ] , 
       1: [ 1 ] ,
       2: [ 2 ] } ,
  1: { 0: [ 3 , 4 ] ,
       1: [ 5 , 6 ] ,
       2: [ 7 , 8 ] } ,
  2: { 0: [ 9 ] } }
\end{verbatim}

\section{Functional evaluation}
In order to construct nodal interpolants or strongly enforce boundary
conditions, FIAT also provides information to numerically evaluate
linear functionals.  These rules are typically exact for a certain
degree polynomial and only approximate on general functions.  For
scalar functions, these rules may be represented by a collection of
points and corresponding weights \( \{ x_i \} , \{ w_i \} \) so that
\[
\ell( f ) \approx w_i f(x_i).
\]

For example, pointwise evaluation at a point \( x \) is simply
represented by the coordinates of \( x \) together with a weight of
1. If the functional is an integral moment, such as
\[
\ell( f ) = \int_K g f \, dx,
\]
then the points \( \{ x_i \} \) will be those of some quadrature rule
and the weights will be \( w_i = \omega_i g(x_i) \), where the \(
\omega_i \) are the quadrature weights.

This framework is extended to support vector- and tensor-valued
function spaces, by including a component corresponding to each point
and weight.  If \( v \) is a vector-valued function and \( v_\alpha \)
is its component, then functionals are written in the form
\[
\ell( v ) \approx w_i v_{\alpha_i}(x_i),
\]
so that the sets of weights, components, and points must be conveyed
to the client.

This framework may also support derivative-based degrees of freedom by
including a multiindex at each point corresponding to a particular
partial derivative.



\section{Overview of fundamental class structure}
Many FEniCS users will never directly use FIAT; for them, interaction will be
moderated through a form compiler such as \texttt{ffc}.  Others will
want to use the FIAT basis functions in other contexts.
At a basic level, a user will access FIAT through top-level classes such as \(
\texttt{Lagrange} \) and \( \texttt{RaviartThomas} \) that implement
the elements.  Typically, the class
constructors accept the reference element and order of function space as
arguments.  This gives an interface that is parametrized by dimension
and degree.  The classes such as \texttt{Lagrange} derive from a base class
\texttt{FiniteElement} that provides access to the three components of
the Ciarlet triple.  

The currently released version of FIAT stores the
reference element as a flag indicating the simplex dimension, although
a development version provides an actual class describing reference
element geometry and topology.  This will allow future releases of
FIAT to be parametrized over the particular reference element shape
and topology.  

The function space \( P \) is modelled by the base class
\texttt{PolynomialSet}, while  contains a rule for
constructing the base polynomials \( \phi_i \) (e.g. the Dubiner
basis) and a multidimensional
array of expansion coefficients for the basis of \( P \).  Special
subclasses of this provide (possibly array-valued) orthogonal bases as
well as the rules for constructing supplemented and constrained
bases.  These classes provide mechanisms for tabulating and
differentiating the polynomials at input points as well as basic
queries such as the dimension of the space.

The set of finite element nodes is similarly modeled by a class
\texttt{DualBasis}.  This provides the functionals of the dual basis
as well as their connection to the reference element facets.
The functionals are modeled by a \texttt{FunctionalSet} object, which
is a collection of \texttt{Functional} objects.
Each \texttt{Functional} object contains a
reference to the \texttt{PolynomialSet} over which it is defined and
the array of coefficients representing it and owns a
\texttt{FunctionalType} class providing the information described in
the previous section.  The
\texttt{FunctionalSet} class batches these coefficients together in a
single large array.

The constructor for the \texttt{FiniteElement} class takes a
\texttt{PolynomialSet} modeling the starting basis and a
\texttt{DualBasis} defined over this basis and constructs a new
\texttt{PolynomialSet} by building and inverting the generalized
Vandermonde matrix.

Beyond this basic finite element structure, FIAT provides quadrature
such as Gauss-Jacobi rules in one dimension and
collapsed-coordinate rules in higher dimensions.  It also provides
routines for constructing lattices of points on eah of the reference
element shapes and their facets.

In the future, FIAT will include the developments discussed already
(more general reference element geometry/topology and automatic
differentiation).  Automatic differentiation will make it easier to
construct finite elements with derivative-type degrees of freedom such
as Hermite, Morley, and Argyris.  Aditionally, 
we hope to expand the collection of quadrature
rules and provide more advanced point distributions, such as
Warburton's warp-blend points~\cite{War05}.
