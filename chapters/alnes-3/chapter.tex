SyFi is a C++ library for definition of finite elements based on
symbolic computations. By solving linear systems of equations
symbolically, symbolic expressions for the basis functions of a finite
element can be obtained. SyFi contains a collection of such elements.

The SyFi Form Compiler, SFC, is a Python module for generation of fi-
nite element code based on symbolic computations. Using equations in
UFL format as input and basis functions from SyFi, SFC can generate
C++ code which implements the UFC interface for computation of the
discretized element tensors. SFC supports generating code based on
quadrature or using symbolic integration prior to code generation to
produce highly optimized code.
