The Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear water-like fluid which occupy
the so-called subanachroid space surrounding the brain within the
scull, the ven- tricles within the brain, and it surrounds the spinal
canal in the neck. In each heart-cycle this fluid is pumped in and out
of the scull due to the expansion of the brain. In this chapter we
will discuss the implementation of a simulator for this phenomena in
FEniCS. Furthermore, we show simulation results that demonstrate the
effects of abnormal CSF flow in particular in association with the
so-called Chiari I malformation.
