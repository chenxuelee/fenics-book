In this chapter, we discuss the implementation of several well-known
finite element based solution algorithms for the Navier-Stokes
equations. We focus on laminar incompressible flows and Newtonian
fluids. Implementations of simple projection methods are compared to
fully implicit schemes such as inexact Uzawa, pressure correction on
the Schur complement, block preconditioning of the saddle point
problem, and least-squares stabilized Galerkin. Numerical stability
and boundary conditions are briefly discussed before we compare the
implementations with respect to efficiency and accuracy for a number
of well established benchmark tests.
