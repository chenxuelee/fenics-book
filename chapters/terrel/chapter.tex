Incompressible fluid models have numerous discretizations each with
its own benefits and problems. This chapter will focus on using FEniCS
to implement discretizations of the Stokes and two non-Newtonian
models, grade two and Oldroyd--B. Special consideration is given to
profiling the discretizaions on several problems.
