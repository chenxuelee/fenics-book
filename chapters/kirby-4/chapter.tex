The tensor constraction structure obtained in the representation
results for variational forms enables not only the construction of a
compiler for variational forms, but an \emph{optimizing} compiler.
For typical variational forms, the reference element tensor has
significant structure that allows it to be contracted for an arbitrary
element tensor in a reduced amount of arithmetic.  Reducing the number
of operations based on this structure leads naturally to several
problems in discrete mathematics.  This chapter introduces the idea of
complexity-reducing relations and discusses compile-time graph and
hypergraph optimization problems that form the core of the FErari
project.
