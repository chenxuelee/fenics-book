In this study, we present a 2D fluid--structure interaction (FSI)
simulation of a channel flow containing an elastic valve that may
undergo large deformations. The FSI occurs when the fluid interacts
with the solid structure of the valve, exerting pressure that causes
deformation of the valve and, thus, alters the flow of the fluid
itself. To describe the equations governing the fluid flow and the
elastic valve, two separate meshes are used and Nitsche's method is
used to couple the equations on the two meshes. The method is based on
continuous piecewise approximations on each mesh with weak enforcement
of the proper continuity at the interface defined by the boundary of
one of the overlapping meshes.
