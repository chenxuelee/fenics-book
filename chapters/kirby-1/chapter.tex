Automation of finite element methods enables advanced, nonstandard
discretizations that offer theoretically superior results but prac-
tical challenges in implementation. In order to enable ``any'' finite
element discretization, one must have an engine capable of construct-
ing basis functions from an abstract specification. This allows a form
compiler to generate code for arbitrary order instances not only of
La- grange finite elements but also Hermite, Argyris, Raviart-Thomas,
and many others. A common goal of both the FIAT and SyFi projects is
to provide a generic mathematical framework for converting Ciarlet's
abstract definition of a finite element into a linear algebraic
framework for evaluating nodal bases. In this chapter, we discuss the
basic theory for constructing nodal bases via generalized Vandermonde
matrices.
