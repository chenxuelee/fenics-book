Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a tool with great potential in
medicine. Using traditional engineering techniques, one may compute,
e.g., the blood flow in arteries and the resulting stress on the
vessel wall to understand, treat, and prevent various cardiovascular
diseases. This chapter is devoted to the computation of blood flow in
large cerebral arteries and its role in the development and rupture of
aneurysms. We discuss the process from generating geometries from
medical imaging data to performing patient-specific simulations of
hemodynamics in FEniCS.  Specifically, we present three different
applications: simulations related to a recently published
study~\cite{kvs-sex} concerning gender differences in cerebral
arteries, a study of the carotid arteries of a canine with an induced
aneurysm~\cite{doggy}, and a study of the blood flow in a healthy
Circle of Willis, where patient-specific velocity measurements are
compared with a model for the peripheral resistance.

\section{Medical background} \label{Medical_Background}

Stroke is a leading cause of death in the developed part of the
world~\cite{feigin}, and mortality rates could increase dramatically
in the years to come~\cite{murray}. Stroke is caused by an
insufficient supply of blood to parts of the brain. There are mainly
two different types of strokes, ischemia caused by obstructions in the
blood vessels, and subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by the rupture of
one or more aneurysms~\cite{humphrey}. Aneurysms typically develop in
or near the so-called Circle of Willis (CoW), which is an arterial
network of vessels at the base of the brain. The function of this
circle is believed to be to ensure a robust and redundant system in
the sense that the brain will receive a sufficient amount of blood
even if one of the vessels is occluded or under-developed. This
network connects the (internal) carotid arteries and the vertebral
arteries into a circle-like structure. This network is the main
supplier of blood to the brain. Figure~\ref{fig:textbook-circle} shows
the circle as typically depicted in textbooks and
Figure~\ref{fig:textbook-circleII} shows a circle with multiple
aneurysms. The Figure~\ref{fig:textbook-circleII} shows the brain as
seen from below where the left part of the brain is removed. Blood
enters the circle through the Internal Carotid Arteries (ICAs), which
is located at the front of the neck and the Vertebral Arteries (VAs)
located in the back of the neck.  The VAs join in the Basilar Artery
(BA),and blood leaves the circle in the front through the Anterior
Cerebral Arteries (ACA), in the back through the Posterior Cerebral
Arteries (PCA), and at the sides through the Middle Cerebral Arteries
(MCA). A patient-specific circle, the one used in Section~\ref{cok},
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circle_kent}.

Aneurysms are relatively common, as many as 1--6\% of the population
develop aneurysms during a lifetime~\cite{weir}. Unfortunately,
aneurysms also rupture at a relatively early age. The average age of
rupture is 52 years~\cite{humphrey}. An intracranial aneurysm is a
dilatation of the blood vessel wall, and the reason for
initialization, growth, and rupture of aneurysms are largely unknown.
What is known is that increased wall shear stress (WSS) affects
vascular endothelial cells turnover~\cite{davies}, that aneurysms may
grow in the direction of low wall shear stress~\cite{boussel}, and
that flow pattern and impingement zones affect the possibility of
rupture~\cite{cebral}. The vessel wall clearly responds to mechanical
stimuli and this is the reason why wall shear stress is of special
importance when trying to understand the pathogenesis of intracranial
aneurysms. It is also known that the cerebral arteries lack
perivascular support and the walls are relatively thin relative to the
rest of the intracranial vasculature~\cite{humphrey,Stehbens}.
Furthermore, the anatomy of cerebral vessels varies greatly. Only
around 50\% of the general population have a complete circle; the rest
either have under-developed vessels or the vessels are missing
completely~\cite{fung}. Both gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle have
shown to be of importance~\cite{Mhurchu,Longstreth,Kongable}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Stress calculation}

We noted above that wall shear stress is of importance in
computational hemodynamics. In Figure~\ref{fig:stress_code}, we
demonstrate how to compute stresses in FEniCS from a computed velocity
field~$u$ and pressure field~$p$. We start from the definition of the
stress tensor $\sigma(u,p) = 2 \nu \varepsilon (u) - p I$, where the
$\varepsilon(u) = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla u + \nabla u^T)$ is the symmetric
gradient. Then, the normal and tangential components of the stress are
computed, where the tangential component is computed by subtracting
the normal component from the traction $T = -\sigma \cdot n$. Here,
$n$ is the inward-pointing unit normal from the vessel wall. In the
code, \emp{n} is the outward-pointing unit normal. To compute the
shear and normal stresses as fields over the mesh, we test the
stresses against piecewise constant test functions scaled by the
inverse area of each facet. We thus obtain a piecewise constant
representation of the stresses which on each cell is equal to the
average stress on that cell.

    \end{python}

      velocity and pressure fields \emp{u} and \emp{p}.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Boundary conditions} \label{resistance_bcs}

For transient inlet boundary conditions, one option is to apply
velocity waveform data in the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) from Ford
et al.~\cite{ford}, where the average velocity was measured for
seventeen young patients at rest. The nondimensionalized velocity is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ford}. The inlet velocity profile is
easy to measure through the ICA or the Vertebral Arteries (VA) using
transcranial Doppler and patient-specific velocity measurements are
possible to apply, such as in the CoW study in Section~\ref{cok}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \fbox{
      \includegraphics[width=80mm]{chapters/kvs-2/eps/systolic.eps}
    }
  \end{center}
  \caption{Nondimensionalized ICA inlet velocity profile.}
  \label{fig:ford}
\end{figure}

Further into the brain, the flow is divided into branches several
times, which makes the outflow difficult to measure, both because of
the thickness of the cranium and the decreasing size of the vessels.
The effect of outflow boundary conditions in a complex network of
blood vessels, such as in the Circle of Willis, is important to the
flow division and wall shear stress.

The simplest way to describe the outflow is by applying a zero
traction boundary condition at the outflow. However, the flow division
in a bifurcation is dependent on the downstream vasculature, and the
zero traction boundary condition does not capture this very
well. Therefore, to model the the peripheral resistance, a resistance
model may be used for the pressure, while a Neumann (${\partial u /
  \partial n} = 0 $) is applied to the velocity. The value of the
resistance boundary condition is proportional to the flow, that is,
the pressure at the outlet is modeled as,
\begin{equation}
  p = p_0 + R = p_0 + C \int_\Gamma (u \cdot n) \dS,
\end{equation}
where the resistance coefficient~$C$ was set according to
Table~\ref{resistance_coeff}, $p_0$ is the mean intracranial arterial
pressure (85 mmHg) which is applied to the inlet and $u$ is the
velocity. The coefficients in Table~\ref{resistance_coeff} are
from~\cite{peiro} and show a clear relation between the diameter of
the vessel and the resistance coefficient. The implementation is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:resistance_code}.

    u = self.problem.u
    n = FacetNormal(self.problem.mesh)
    flux = dot(u, n)*ds(i)
    Q = assemble(flux, exterior_facet_domains=self.problem.sub_domains)
    C = 5.97*10**(-3)
    p0 = 11332.0*10**(-6) # Bloodpressure, 85 mmHg in Pa
    R = (C*Q + p0)*975.6097560975611

    return R

    \end{python}

    \label{fig:resistance_code}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The effect of the resistance boundary condition may bee seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:resistance_bcs_fig} where the mass flux over two
outlets in the canine geometry in Section~\ref{dog_study} is
calculated using both zero traction and a resistance boundary
condition. The resulting flow division is clearly more evenly
distributed (colored in red) between the daughter vessels, which
intuitively also makes sense since the vessels reconnect further
downstream. The method requires a iteration over a few cardiac cycles
in order to converge.

    \caption{Image segmentation process; from MRI to mesh.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Segmentation of patient-specific geometries are based upon CTA or MRA
images. A stack of 2D images is used as input to the Vascular Modeling
Toolkit (VMTK)~\cite{vmtk}, where 3D surface model is generated by using
various level set techniques. A volume can then created from the surface from
which a mesh can be generated. This process is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:imagseg}, where the mesh of a blood vessel extracted from the
geometry is shown to the right. The final mesh is used as input in the
FEniCS fluid flow solver.

\section{Gender differences in the intracranial vasculature} \label{gender}

In this section, we present an overview of a study recently published
in~\cite{kvs-sex} where it is shown that on average, women have larger
shear stresses than men in two intracranial bifurcations.

\subsection{Background}

Females are more likely to harbor intracranial aneurysms than men and,
consequentially, more frequently get subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH)~\cite{humphrey,eden}. The reason is not known, but studies
suggest an increased risk of aneurysm rupture after the age of fifty,
in the postmenopausal years. This might indicate the influence of
hormonal factors on the vessel wall. This hypothesis is supported by
the reduced risk of SAH with increased parity. However, studies have
failed to prove a decisive correlation between hormonal factors and
the risk of SAH. Another hypothesis is that high values of wall shear
stress may influence the initialization of aneurysms. With
measurements of radii and angles of intracranial bifurcations
available from a previous study in our group~\cite{tor}, we therefore
wished to reanalyze the data and calculate the gender specific
hemodynamic forces by numerical simulations.

\subsection{Method}

Measurements of 49 patients were performed to obtain the geometries of
the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA)
bifurcations. The averaged values were used to create one idealized
bifurcation of the MCA and ICA for both females and males. The model
basically consists of three cylinders connected with a smoothing at
the interface to give a physiologically correct appearance.

Average gender specific blood flow velocity measurements from the ICA
and MCA from~\cite{krejza} were used as inflow boundary conditions in
the simulations. Table~\ref{bcs} summarizes the input values to the
simulations, cf.~\cite{kvs-sex}.  At the outflows, we have applied a
resistance boundary condition as described in
Section~\ref{resistance_bcs}.

\subsection{Results}

Table~\ref{bcs} shows that there is a significant gender difference in
the diameters for the MCA. For ICA,  there are only
statistical sex differences in the vessel size of the parent vessel
and the smallest branch. CFD simulations shown both increased wall
shear stress and a larger affected area in the female MCA
(Figure~\ref{fig:mca_wss_res}) and ICA (Figure~\ref{fig:ica_wss_res})
bifurcations. The maximum wall shear stress in the MCA bifurcations
was 33.17~Pa for females and 27.82~Pa for males. Similar results for
ICA were 15.20~Pa for females and~10.10 Pa for males. The values are
reflected by a higher pressure drop in the female than the male
bifurcations (664 vs 502 Pa for MCA and 344 vs 202 Pa for ICA). For
further discussion, see~\cite{kvs-sex}.

\subsection{Discussion}

The above results are as expected from fluid mechanical reasoning,
except from the peak values in the vicinity of the bifurcations. Even
though the model is simple, the aim was to demonstrate a principle
with a potentially important application, that is, that WSS may be of
importance in the initialization and rupture of IA.  Furthermore, the
WSS computed based on the simulations suggest that women would have
more aneurysms than men.

\section{CFD versus 4D PC MRA in an experimental canine aneurysm} \label{dog_study}

In this study, see also~\cite{doggy}, we quantitatively compared CFD,
assuming Newtonian flow with rigid walls, with 4-Dimensional Phase
Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (4D PC MRA) techniques. The
intention was both to verify the scientific techniques of going from a
patient-specific model to CFD results and to understand and quantify
the accuracy of the simplest possible flow model against
state-of-the-art measurements.

4D PC MRA is a noninvasive technique to measure flow in the
vasculature system. The image acquisition consists of a scan time of
roughly 8 minutes. With an average heart rate of 101 beats per minute,
the obtained images are an average over 808 heart cycles. There is
naturally no guarantee for a constant heart beat in the canine, and
this is of course error prone. However, in humans with larger
diameters in the vasculatory system, errors have been shown to be of
order 3-10+\% in the pulmonary arteries~\cite{JoachimLotz,EvansAJ}.

The resolution is coarse in both space and time, and computation of
forces such as WSS might be difficult. In addition to this, there
might be locations in the vascular system where stenosis/plaque is
present and the quality of the 4D PC MRA might be poor. These are
also often the spots of most interest. In many cases, there are also
problems with the Velocity Encoding Sensitivity (VENC) which may
produce noise and useless data. The VENC may be adjusted to capture a
velocity within a specific range. However, less accurate data is
obtained for a wide VENC and vice versa.

\subsection{MRI}

To test the above mentioned techniques in a complex case, our
collaborators at Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research
(\url{http://www.med.wisc.edu/wimr/}) created an artificial saccular
aneurysm in a carotid bifurcation of a canine according
to~\cite{german}. The inlet diameter was $3.2 \mathrm{mm}$, the height
$9.4 \mathrm{mm}$, the width $4.3 \mathrm{mm}$, the volume $254.3
\mathrm{mm}^3$, the ostium area $17.10 \mathrm{mm}^2$, and the aspect
ratio $2.18$, where the aspect ratio is defined as the ratio between
the aneurysm height and the neck width.

Three weeks after the artificial aneurysm was created, the canine was
anesthetized and subjected to 4D PC MRA imaging studies, that is, the
velocity measurements were performed. The velocity measurements are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mass_dog} where each solid line represents
the sum of velocities at different cross sections of the inlet and
outlet arteries. The picture to the left in Figure~\ref{fig:mass_dog}
shows the sum of velocities at the inlet, which is one artery, while
the picture to the right show both the arteries where the outflow
is. For a more thorough description, we refer to~\cite{doggy}. To get
higher resolution images (of the vasculature only and not flow
measurements), the canine underwent 3D-DSA within 24 hours. The coarse
data obtained from 4D PC MRA is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dog_mri}.

    measurements are made (left), velocity measurements from 4D PC MRA
    (middle), and CFD simulations (right).}
  \label{fig:dog_mri}
\end{figure}

\subsection{CFD}

The geometry was produced according to the procedure described in
Section~\ref{vmtk}. We solved the incompressible Navier--Stokes
equations using an incremental pressure correction scheme as described
in Chapter~[kvs-1]. We used first order elements for both velocity and
pressure, simulated over four heart beats, and obtained the results
from the last cycle. The CFL number is a dimensionless number that
describes the temporal resolution relative to the grid spacing.  With
a CFL number of roughly ten, the number of time steps were 696 per
cardiac cycle. As inflow boundary conditions, we used an average value
from the five lower most voxels in the $z$-direction. For the outflow,
we applied a resistance boundary condition as described in section
~\ref{resistance_bcs}. The inflow was chosen according to
Figure~\ref{fig:inflow_codeI} and Figure~\ref{fig:inflow_codeII}.

Figure~\ref{fig:inflow_codeI} shows how the values in
Figure~\ref{fig:mass_dog} are returned as a spline function. The
factor \emp{(133.0/256)**-2} scales the voxel size to the matrix size,
so that the focus of the image corresponds to the actual size in
millimeters, and returns a value for the velocity. The \emp{t}
variable is the end time, and the scalar $0.037$ is the equally spaced
time steps of where measurements for \emp{v} were made.

    \end{python}
    \caption{Measured values used for spline representation for the inflow.}
    \label{fig:inflow_codeI}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:inflow_codeII}, a call is made to generate a spline
representation of the velocity in time by calling \emp{makeIC()}.
Then, in \emp{eval\_data}, \emp{n} is the outward facing facet normal
and \emp{t} is the time. The variable \emp{val} is a spline evaluation
such that the pulse goes in a continued cycle as time exceeds one
heart beat. Finally, each component of the velocity vector, e.g.,
\emp{values[0]}, is given the component-wise negative value of \emp{n}
(to create a flow going into the domain) times the velocity value
corresponding to the current time.

    \end{python}
    \caption{Calculation of inflow boundary value for velocity.}
    \label{fig:inflow_codeII}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}

The resulting velocity field from 4D PC MRA and CFD calculations
during peak systole are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dog_mri}, and
illustrates an overall good agreement between CFD and 4D PC MRA. For
both canines (second one not included here), we obtained a similarity
of more than 70\% with respect to the velocity but only 22-31\%
similarity with respect to the WSS. For further details, we refer
to~\cite{doggy}.

\subsection{Discussion}

The reason for using the average values of the five lower most cross
sections as inflow is that given the resolution of the 4D PC MRA, each
level of voxels is not necessarily mass conserving. As seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:mass_dog}, the sum of mass in a plane may vary by as
much as 20\% between the different sections.  It is also clearly
visible in this figure that peak systole appears at time step four in
both left (inflow) and right (outflow) image of the figure, but the
``bump'' at mid deceleration has shifted from time step seven at the
inflow to eight at the outflow.  This is a visualization of the
so-called Windkessel effect, which may be captured using a fluid
structure interaction model. This effect is also visible as the
variation of how much the lines are spread vertically through the
heart cycle.


A limitation of the current study is that the results should not be
interpreted as physiologically correct since the technique consists of
cutting off one of the ICAs and creating an artificial bifurcation
(and aneurysm) by moving the rest of the vessel over to the other
ICA. This means that one of the ICAs supply both left and right sides
of the canine brain.

In the 4D PC MRA measurements at the left side of the parent artery in
Figure~\ref{fig:dog_mri}, there are no boundary layers due to
isotropic voxels, and the colors appear brighter since high velocities
are possible close to the wall.  The CFD simulations have short arrows
at the same location indicating that the boundary layer has been
resolved and we get lower velocities. This is an obvious drawback with
the 4D PC MRA. Thus, we get a good agreement with the velocity
measurements, but poor agreement for computed wall shear stresses. The
reason for this is believed to be the poor spatial resolution of the
4D PC MRA data. For a more thorough description, we refer
to~\cite{doggy}.

Each method has its own strength and weaknesses. While 4D PC MRA is
fast, cheap, and harmless, it uses average values over a voxel volume
and fails to correctly compute WSS, recirculation zones, and possible
turbulent structures. 4D PC MRA also fails at providing values where
the VENC is out of focus or in the presence of a stenosis. Similarly,
CFD is expensive but may provide accurate computations of WSS over the
entire domain.

Combined, the two methods may give a better understanding of the
importance of boundary conditions, whether or not fluid structure
interaction is of importance, and possible pitfalls using the
different methods. A first natural extension of this study may be to
describe blood as a non-Newtonian fluid to determine whether or not
non-Newtonian effects are of importance.

\section{Patient-specific Circle of Willis} \label{cok}

\subsection{Background}

In a study performed in collaboration with doctors from the
Neuroradiology department at Rikshospitalet University Hospital in
Oslo~\cite{rh}, we wanted to investigate whether we are able to
reproduce velocities in a full Circle of Willis with measurements at
the inflow and compare with measurements at the outflow using
resistance boundary conditions from the literature~\cite{peiro,
  VignonClementel}. Such an evaluation or verification of boundary
conditions is essential, before proceeding with more sophisticated
problems related to the entire intracranial vasculature.

  \label{fig:cok_inflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Method}

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was performed at a healthy volunteer at
rest. During the velocity recording, the average pulse was about 73
beats per minute. The velocity measurements of maximum and minimum
values were used as input to the vessels that are the main suppliers
of blood to the brain, that is, the ICAs and
VAs. Figure~\ref{fig:cok_inflow} shows the resulting waveform (right)
that was applied from the measurements (left). The figure shows the
ICA velocities from the top with equal value at peak systole (120cm/s)
and differing at end diastole (minimum 50cm/s in right ICA and 20 cm/s
in left ICA). The lower most line has a different waveform and shows
values for two superimposed VAs since they are equal. The vasculature,
that is, the MRI data for this patient was already available from a
previous study performed nine months earlier. The major vessels (ICA,
MCA, PCA, ACA, VA, BA) were segmented as described in
Section~\ref{vmtk}. The simulations were performed on meshes with
three boundary layers where the number of cells were approximately
$400,000$, $900,000$, and $2,600,000$. We used $P1$--$P1$ elements and
an incremental pressure correction scheme with Adams--Bashford
implicit convection and Crank--Nicolson diffusion to solve the
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The resolution in time was
3532 time steps per heart beat on the coarsest mesh.

Figure~\ref{fig:outflow_code} shows how the outflow boundary
conditions are set. The numbers 6 to 13 refer to the labels for the
different outlets. For each outlet, the class
\emp{OutflowBoundaryValue()} is called, which returns a value for the
pressure. Finally, the specific outlet is applied to a list of
boundary conditions used in the Navier--Stokes solver.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}

Based upon images obtained from TCD, we compare only one point in
time, peak systole. Since there is a large difference in the sum of
inflow areas and the outflow areas, we only consider the flow division
between the arteries compared to measurements.
Table~\ref{measure_vs_comp} shows the measured and calculated
velocities for the major arteries.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}  {  c | c | c | c | c }
    Artery & Left Measured & Left Computed & Right Measured & Right Computed \\
    \hline
    MCA & 70, 120 		& 87  & 140,150 	& 55	\\
    ACA & 200  		& 100  	& 90,100 	& 65	\\
    PCA & 70,80  		& 62 	& 80  		& 100  \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

    weeks difference in time.}
  \label{measure_vs_comp}
\end{table}

\subsection{Discussion}

The results of the current study do not match very well with measured
values. This may indicate that the type of boundary conditions applied
here may not describe the peripheral resistance properly. However,
there are many sources of error that must be considered.  First, TCD
is difficult to perform and subject to errors. Personal communication
with the neuroradiologist suggests errors at the scale of 20\%.
Second, we have no information on when peak systole appears in the
different arteries. It seams reasonable that there is a small shift in
time since the blood goes from the heart and through different
arteries before it meets in CoW. At present, we have not been able to
quantify this shift. Third, the velocity itself may differ at
different times for various reasons. This is illustrated by the cells
containing two values in Table~\ref{measure_vs_comp}, which refers to
two measurements of the same vessel in the same person only 5 weeks
apart.

It is also a great challenge to segment the complete CoW due to the
great variations in diameters. This is clearly visible when performing
an automatic segmentation where many of the smaller vessels disappear.
It is known that the BA has approximately 50 tiny vessels that are
clearly not present in Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot}. The reason for
this is that MRA measurements are based upon velocities, and hence the
velocities in these vessels are too small to be captured. By
calculating and summing up the in- and outflow areas using the code in
Figure~\ref{fig:area_code}, we actually get an area difference of
$37.18mm^2-25.33mm^2=11.85mm^2$. It is not known what the correct area
should be.

The simulations also show that it might be a problematic to not
include a large fraction of the parent artery when performing
simulations on a smaller fraction of the vasculature. It is common to
apply either a flat velocity profile or a Womersley profile upstream
of the location of interest. This is clearly not the case as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:cok_ica} where the flow is highly non-uniform.
