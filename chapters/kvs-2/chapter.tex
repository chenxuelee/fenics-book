Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a tool with great potential in
medicine. Using traditional engineering techniques, one may compute,
e.g., the blood flow in arteries and the resulting stress on the
vessel wall to understand, treat and prevent various cardiovascular
diseases. This chapter is devoted to the computation of blood flow in
large cerebral arteries and the blood flow's role in the development 
and rupture of
aneurysms. We discuss the process from generating geometries from
medical imaging data to performing patient-specific simulations of
hemodynamics in FEniCS.  Specifically, we present three different
applications: simulations related to a recently published study
by~\citet{LindekleivValen-SendstadMorganEtAl2010} concerning gender
differences in cerebral arteries, a study of the carotid arteries of a
canine with an induced aneurysm described
in~\citet{JiangJohnsonValen-SendstadEtAl2010}, and a study of the blood
flow in a healthy Circle of Willis, where patient-specific velocity
measurements are compared with a model for the peripheral resistance.

\section{Medical background} \label{Medical_Background}

Stroke is a leading cause of death in the developed part of the
world~\citep{Feigin2005}, and mortality rates could increase
dramatically in the years to come~\citep{MurrayLopez1997}. Stroke is
caused by an insufficient supply of blood to parts of the brain. There
are mainly two different types of strokes, ischemia caused by
obstructions in the blood vessels, and subarachnoid hemorrhage caused
by the rupture of one or more aneurysms. Aneurysms
typically develop in or near the so-called Circle of Willis (CoW),
which is an arterial network of vessels at the base of the brain. The
function of this circle is believed to be to ensure a robust and
redundant system in the sense that the brain will receive a sufficient
amount of blood even if one of the vessels is occluded or
under-developed. This network connects the internal carotid arteries
(ICA) and the vertebral arteries (VA) into a circle-like
structure. This network is the main supplier of blood to the
brain. Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:textbook-circle} shows the circle as
typically depicted in textbooks. Blood enters the circle through the
ICAs, which are located at the front of the neck and the VAs located
in the back of the neck.  The VAs join in the Basilar Artery (BA), and
blood leaves the circle in the front through the Anterior Cerebral
Arteries (ACA), in the back through the Posterior Cerebral Arteries
(PCA), and at the sides through the Middle Cerebral Arteries (MCA). A
patient-specific circle, the one used in Section~\ref{cok}, is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:circle_kent}.

Aneurysms are relatively common. As many as 1--6\% of the population
develop aneurysms during their
lifetime~\citep{Weir2002}. Unfortunately, aneurysms also rupture at a
relatively early age. The average age of rupture is 52
years~\citep{Humphrey2001}. An intracranial aneurysm is a dilatation of
the blood vessel wall, and the reason for initialization, growth and
rupture of aneurysms are largely unknown.  What is known is that
increased wall shear stress (WSS) affects vascular endothelial cell
turnover~\citep{DAVIESREMUZZIGORDONEtAl1986}, that aneurysms may grow
in the direction of low wall shear
stress~\citep{BousselRayzMcCullochEtAl2008}, and that flow pattern and
impingement zones affect the possibility of
rupture~\citep{CebralCastroBurgessEtAl2005}. The vessel wall clearly
responds to mechanical stimuli and this is the reason why wall shear
stress is of special importance when trying to understand the
pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms. It is also known that the
cerebral arteries lack perivascular support and the walls are
relatively thin relative to the rest of the intracranial
vasculature~\citep{Humphrey2001,Stehbens1975}.  Furthermore, the
anatomy of cerebral vessels varies greatly. Only around 50\% of the
general population have a complete circle; the rest either have
under-developed vessels or the vessels are missing
completely~\citep{Fung1984}. Gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle have
shown to be of
importance~\citep{MhurchuAndersonJamrozikEtAl2001,LongstrethNelsonKoepsellEtAl1994,KongableLanzinoGermansonEtAl1996}.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Stress calculation}

We noted above that wall shear stress is of importance in
computational hemodynamics. In Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:stress_code}, we
demonstrate how to compute stresses in FEniCS from a computed velocity
field~$u$ and pressure field~$p$. We start from the definition of the
stress tensor $\sigma(u,p) = 2 \nu \varepsilon (u) - p I$, where the
$\varepsilon(u) = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla u + \nabla u^T)$ is the symmetric
velocity gradient. Then, the normal and tangential components of the
stress are computed, where the tangential component is computed by
subtracting the normal component from the traction $T = \sigma \cdot
n$. Here, $n$ is the inward-pointing unit normal from the vessel
wall. In the code, \emp{n} is the outward-pointing unit normal. To
compute the shear and normal stresses as fields over the mesh, we test
the stresses against piecewise constant test functions scaled by the
inverse area of each facet. We thus obtain a piecewise constant
representation of the stresses which on each cell is equal to the
average stress on that cell.

    \end{python}

      velocity and pressure fields \emp{u} and \emp{p}.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Boundary conditions} \label{resistance_bcs}

For transient inlet boundary conditions, one option is to apply
velocity waveform data in the ICA
from~\citet{FordAlperinLeeEtAl2005}, where the average velocity was
measured for seventeen young patients at rest. The nondimensionalized
velocity is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:ford}. The inlet
velocity profile is easy to measure through the ICA or the
VA using transcranial Doppler. This enables
patient-specific velocity measurements such as in the CoW study in
Section~\ref{cok}.



\begin{figure}
  \begin{center} \fbox{ \includegraphics[width=\largefig]{chapters/kvs-2/pdf/systolic.pdf}
    } \end{center} \caption{Nondimensionalized ICA inlet velocity
    profile.}  \label{fig:kvs-2:ford}
\end{figure}

Further into the brain, the flow is divided into branches several
times, which makes the outflow difficult to measure, both because of
the thickness of the cranium and the decreasing size of the vessels.
The effect of outflow boundary conditions in a complex network of
blood vessels, such as in the Circle of Willis, is important to the
flow division and wall shear stress.

The simplest way to describe the outflow is by applying a zero
traction boundary condition at the outflow. However, the flow division
in a bifurcation is dependent on the downstream vasculature, and the
zero traction boundary condition does not capture this very
well. Therefore, to model the the peripheral resistance, a resistance
model may be used for the pressure, while a Neumann condition
(${\partial u / \partial n} = 0 $) is applied to the velocity. The
value of the resistance boundary condition is proportional to the
flow, that is, the pressure at the outlet is modeled as,
\begin{equation}
  p = p_0 + R = p_0 + C \int_\Gamma u \cdot n \dS,
\end{equation}
where the resistance coefficient~$C$ was set according to
Table~\ref{resistance_coeff}, $p_0$ is the mean intracranial arterial
pressure (85 mmHg) which is applied to the inlet and $u$ is the
velocity. The coefficients in Table~\ref{resistance_coeff} are
from~\citet{AlastrueyParkerPeiroEtAl2007} and show a clear relation
between the diameter of the vessel and the resistance coefficient. The
implementation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:resistance_code}.

and $10**(-6)$ to convert from SI units to millimeters, milliseconds and grams.}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The effect of the resistance boundary condition may bee seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:resistance_bcs_fig} where the mass flux over two
outlets in the canine geometry in Section~\ref{dog_study} is
calculated using both zero traction and a resistance boundary
condition. The resulting flow division is clearly more evenly
distributed (colored in red) between the daughter vessels, which
intuitively also makes sense since the vessels reconnect further
downstream. The method requires an iteration over a few cardiac cycles
in order to converge.

    flux when a resistance boundary condition (as described in section
    ~\ref{resistance_bcs}) is applied versus zero traction. When a
    resistance boundary condition is used, the flow is more evenly
    distributed between the two vessel outlets (red curves), compared
    to the case when a zero traction condition is used (blue and green
    curves).}

\end{figure*}

Segmentation of patient-specific geometries are based upon Computed
Tomography Angiography (CTA) or Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)
images. A stack of 2D images is used as input to the Vascular Modeling
Toolkit (VMTK)~\citep{vmtk}, where a 3D surface model is generated
based upon the light intensity in the pictures using
level set techniques. A volume is then created from the surface, from
which a mesh can be generated. This process is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:imagseg}, where the mesh of a blood vessel
extracted from the geometry is shown to the right. The final mesh is
used as input to the flow solver.

\section{Gender differences in the intracranial vasculature} \label{gender}

In this section, we present an overview of a recent study
by~\citet{LindekleivValen-SendstadMorganEtAl2010} where it is shown
that on average, women have larger shear stresses than men in two
intracranial bifurcations.

\subsection{Background}

Females are more likely to harbor intracranial aneurysms than men and,
consequentially, more frequently get subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH)~\citep{EdenMeurerSanchezEtAl2008}. The reason is not
known, but studies suggest an increased risk of aneurysm rupture after
the age of fifty, in the postmenopausal years. This might indicate the
influence of hormonal factors on the vessel wall. This hypothesis is
supported by the reduced risk of SAH with increased parity. However,
studies have failed to prove a decisive correlation between hormonal
factors and the risk of SAH. Another hypothesis is that high values of
wall shear stress may influence the initialization of aneurysms. With
measurements of radii and angles of intracranial bifurcations
available from a previous study in our group,
see~\citet{IngebrigtsenMorganFaulderEtAl2004}, we therefore wished to
reanalyze the data and calculate the gender specific hemodynamic
forces by numerical simulations.

\subsection{Method}

Measurements of 49 patients were performed to obtain the geometries of
the MCA and ICA bifurcations. The averaged values for the diameters
were used to create one idealized
bifurcation of the MCA and ICA for both females and males. The model
basically consists of three cylinders connected with a smoothing at
the interface to give a physiologically correct appearance.

Average gender specific blood flow velocity measurements from the ICA
and MCA from~\citet{KrejzaSzydlikLiebeskindEtAl2005} were used as
inflow boundary conditions in the simulations. Table~\ref{bcs}
summarizes the input values to the simulations,
cf.~\citet{LindekleivValen-SendstadMorganEtAl2010}.  At the outflows,
we have applied a resistance boundary condition as described in
Section~\ref{resistance_bcs}.

\subsection{Results}

Table~\ref{bcs} shows that there is a significant gender difference in
the diameters for the MCA. For the ICA, there are only statistical sex
differences in the vessel size of the parent vessel and the smallest
branch. CFD simulations show both increased wall shear stress and a
larger affected area in the female MCA
(Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:mca_wss_res}) and ICA
(Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:ica_wss_res}) bifurcations. The maximum wall
shear stress in the MCA bifurcations was 33.17~Pa for females and
27.82~Pa for males. Similar results for ICA were 15.20~Pa for females
and~10.10 Pa for males. The values are reflected by a higher pressure
drop in the female than the male bifurcations (664 vs 502 Pa for MCA
and 344 vs 202 Pa for ICA). For further discussion,
see~\citet{LindekleivValen-SendstadMorganEtAl2010}.

\subsection{Discussion}

The above results are as expected from fluid mechanical reasoning,
except from the peak values in the vicinity of the bifurcations. Even
though the model is simple, the aim was to demonstrate a principle
with a potentially important application, that is, that WSS may be of
importance in the initialization and rupture of intracranial
aneurysms. Furthermore, the results suggest that women develop more
aneurysms than men.

\section{CFD versus 4D PC MRA in an experimental canine aneurysm} \label{dog_study}

In another study, see~\citet{JiangJohnsonValen-SendstadEtAl2010}, we
quantitatively compared CFD, assuming Newtonian flow with rigid walls,
with four-dimensional Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography
(PC MRA) techniques. The intention was both to verify the scientific
techniques of going from a patient-specific model to CFD results and
to understand and quantify the accuracy of the simplest possible flow
model against state-of-the-art measurements.

Four-dimensional PC MRA is a noninvasive technique to measure flow in
the vascular system. The image acquisition consists of a scan time of
roughly 8 minutes. The canine had  an average heart rate
of 101 beats per minute,
so the obtained images are an average over 808 heart cycles. There is
naturally no guarantee for a constant heart beat in the canine, and
this is of course error prone. However, in humans with larger
diameters in the vasculatory system, errors have been shown to be of
order 3-10+\% in the pulmonary arteries;
see~\citet{LotzMeierLeppertEtAl2002,EvansIwaiGristEtAl1993}.

The resolution is coarse in both space and time, and computation of
forces such as WSS might be difficult. In addition to this, there
might be locations in the vascular system where stenosis/plaque is
present and the quality of the 4D PC MRA might be poor. These are also
often the spots of most interest. In many cases, there are also
problems with the Velocity Encoding Sensitivity (VENC) which may
produce noise and useless data. The VENC may be adjusted to capture a
velocity within a specific range. However, less accurate data is
obtained for a wide VENC and vice versa.

\subsection{Phase contrast magnetic resonance angiography}

To test the above mentioned techniques in a complex case, our
collaborators at the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical
Research\footnote{\url{http://www.med.wisc.edu/wimr/}} created an
artificial saccular aneurysm in a carotid bifurcation of a canine
according to~\citet{GermanBlack1965}. The inlet diameter was
$3.2\,\mathrm{mm}$, the height $9.4\,\mathrm{mm}$, the width
$4.3\,\mathrm{mm}$, the volume $254.3\,\mathrm{mm}^3$, the ostium area
$17.10\,\mathrm{mm}^2$, and the aspect ratio $2.18$, where the aspect
ratio is defined as the ratio between the aneurysm height and the neck
width.

Three weeks after the artificial aneurysm was created, the canine was
anesthetized and subjected to 4D PC MRA imaging studies; that is, the
velocity measurements were performed. The raw data from the 4D PC MRA
scan measurements are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:mass_dog} where each solid line
represents the sum of fluxes at different cross sections of the
inlet and outlet arteries. The picture to the left in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:mass_dog} shows the sum of velocities at the
inlet, which is one artery, while the picture to the right show both
the arteries where the outflow is. For a more thorough description, we
refer to~\citet{JiangJohnsonValen-SendstadEtAl2010}. To get higher
resolution images (of the vasculature only and not flow measurements),
the canine underwent 3D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) within
24 hours. The coarse data obtained from 4D PC MRA is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:dog_mri} (left and middle).

\subsection{Computational fluid dynamics}

The geometry was generated according to the procedure described in
Section~\ref{vmtk}. We solved the incompressible Navier--Stokes
equations using an Incremental Pressure Correction Scheme (IPCS) as
described in Chapter~\ref{chap:kvs-1}. We used first order elements
for both velocity and pressure, simulated over four heart beats, and
obtained the results from the last cycle. The CFL number is a
dimensionless number that describes the temporal resolution relative
to the grid spacing.  With a CFL number of roughly ten, the number of
time steps was 696 per cardiac cycle. As inflow boundary conditions,
we used an average value from the five lower most voxels (three
dimensional pixels / samples from the measurements) in the
$z$-direction. For the outflow, we applied a resistance boundary
condition as described in section ~\ref{resistance_bcs}. The inflow
was calculated according to Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:inflow_codeI} and
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:inflow_codeII}.

Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:inflow_codeI} shows how the values in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:mass_dog} are returned as a spline function. The
factor \emp{(133.0/256)**-2} scales the voxel size to the matrix size,
so that the focus of the image corresponds to the actual size in
millimeters, and returns a value for the velocity. The \emp{t}
variable is the end time, and the scalar $0.037$ is the equally spaced
times of where measurements for \emp{v} were made.

In Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:inflow_codeII}, a call is made to generate a spline
representation of the velocity in time by calling \emp{makeIC()}.
Then, in \emp{eval\_data}, \emp{n} is the outward facing facet normal
and \emp{t} is the time. The variable \emp{val} is a spline evaluation
such that the pulse goes in a continued cycle as time exceeds one
heart beat. Finally, each component of the velocity vector, e.g.,
\emp{values[0]}, is given the component-wise negative value of \emp{n}
(to create a flow going into the domain) times the velocity value
corresponding to the current time.

\subsection{Results}

The resulting velocity field from 4D PC MRA and CFD calculations
during peak systole are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:dog_mri}, and
illustrates an overall good agreement between CFD and 4D PC MRA. For
both canines (second one not included here), we obtained a similarity
of more than 70\% with respect to the velocity but only 22-31\%
similarity with respect to the WSS. For further details, we refer
to~\citet{JiangJohnsonValen-SendstadEtAl2010}.

\subsection{Discussion}

The reason for using the average values of the five lower most cross
sections as inflow is that given the resolution of the 4D PC MRA, each
level of voxels is not necessarily mass conserving. As seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:mass_dog}, the sum of mass in a plane may vary by as
much as 20\% between the different sections (the solid lines).  It is also clearly
visible in this figure that peak systole appears at time step four in
both left (inflow) and right (outflow) image of the figure, but the
``bump'' at mid deceleration has shifted from time step seven at the
inflow to eight at the outflow.  This is a visualization of the
so-called Windkessel effect, which may be captured using a fluid
structure interaction model. This effect is also visible as the
variation of how much the lines are spread vertically through the
heart cycle.

A limitation of the current study is that the results should not be
interpreted as physiologically correct since the technique consists of
cutting off one of the ICAs and creating an artificial bifurcation
(and aneurysm) by moving the rest of the vessel over to the other
ICA. This means that one of the ICAs supply both left and right sides
of the canine brain.

In the 4D PC MRA measurements at the left side of the parent artery in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:dog_mri}, there are no boundary layers due to
isotropic voxels, and the colors appear brighter since high velocities
are possible close to the wall.  The CFD simulations have short arrows
at the same location indicating that the boundary layer has been
resolved and we get lower velocity magnitudes.
This is an obvious drawback with
the 4D PC MRA. Thus, we get a good agreement with the velocity
measurements, but poor agreement for computed wall shear stresses. The
reason for this is believed to be the poor spatial resolution of the
4D PC MRA data. For a more thorough description, we refer
to~\citet{JiangJohnsonValen-SendstadEtAl2010}.

Each of the two methods has its strengths and weaknesses. While 4D PC
MRA is fast, cheap, and harmless, it uses average values over a voxel
volume and fails to correctly compute WSS, recirculation zones, and
possible turbulent structures. It also fails to provide values where
the VENC is out of focus or in the presence of a stenosis. In
contrast, CFD is expensive but may provide accurate computations of
WSS over the entire domain.

Combined, the two methods may give a better understanding of the
importance of boundary conditions, whether or not fluid structure
interaction is of importance, and possible pitfalls using the
different methods. A first natural extension of this study may be to
describe blood as a non-Newtonian fluid to determine whether or not
non-Newtonian effects are of importance.

\section{Patient-specific Circle of Willis} \label{cok}

\subsection{Background}

In a study performed in collaboration with doctors from the
Neuroradiology department at Rikshospitalet University Hospital in
Oslo\footnote{\url{http://www.rikshospitalet.no}}, we wanted to
investigate whether we are able to reproduce velocities in a full
Circle of Willis with measurements at the inflow and compare with
measurements at the outflow using resistance boundary conditions from
the
literature~\citep{AlastrueyParkerPeiroEtAl2007,Vignon-ClementelFigueroaJansenEtAl2006}.
Such an evaluation or verification of boundary conditions is
essential, before proceeding with more sophisticated problems related
to the entire intracranial vasculature.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Method}

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was performed on a healthy volunteer at
rest. During the velocity recording, the average pulse was about 73
beats per minute. The velocity measurements
were used as input to the vessels that are the main suppliers
of blood to the brain, that is, the ICAs and
VAs. Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:cok_inflow} shows the resulting waveform
(right) that was applied from the measurements (left). The figure
shows the ICA velocities from the top with equal value at peak systole
(120cm/s) and differing at end diastole (minimum 50cm/s in right ICA
and 20 cm/s in left ICA). The lower most line has a different waveform
and shows values for two superimposed VAs since they are equal. The
vasculature (based on an MRA scan) for this patient was already available from a
previous study performed nine months earlier. The major vessels (ICA,
MCA, PCA, ACA, VA, BA) were segmented as described in
Section~\ref{vmtk}. The simulations were performed on meshes with
three boundary layers where the number of tetrahedron cells were approximately
$400\;000$, $900\;000$ and $2\;600\;000$. We used
$\mathcal{P}_1$--$\mathcal{P}_1$ elements and an incremental pressure
correction scheme with Adams--Bashford implicit convection and
Crank--Nicolson diffusion to solve the incompressible Navier--Stokes
equations. The resolution in time was 3532 time steps per heart beat
on the coarsest mesh.

%Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:outflow_code} shows how the outflow boundary
%conditions are set. The numbers 6 to 13 refer to the labels for the
%different outlets. For each outlet, the class
%\emp{OutflowBoundaryValue()} is called, which returns a value for the
%pressure. Finally, the specific outlet is applied to a list of
%boundary conditions used in the Navier--Stokes solver.

\subsection{Results}

Based upon images obtained from TCD, we compare only one point in
time: peak systole. Since there is a large difference in the sum of
inflow areas and outflow areas, we consider only the flow division
between the arteries compared to measurements.
Table~\ref{measure_vs_comp} shows the measured and calculated
velocities for the major arteries.

  \begin{tabular}  {  c | c | c | c | c }
    Artery &Measured, L&Computed, L &Measured, R&Computed, R \\
    \hline

    ACA & 200  		& 100  	& 90, 100 	& 65	\\
    PCA & 70, 80  		& 62 	& 80  		& 100  \\
  \end{tabular}

    systole. The cells with two values refer to different measurements

  \label{measure_vs_comp}
\end{table}

\subsection{Discussion}

The results of the current study do not match very well with measured
values. This may indicate that the type of boundary conditions applied
here may not describe the peripheral resistance properly. However,
there are many sources of error that must be considered.  First, TCD
is difficult to perform and subject to errors. Personal communication
with the neuroradiologist suggests errors at the scale of 20\%.
Second, we have no information on when peak systole appears in the
different arteries. It seams reasonable that there is a small shift in
time since the blood goes from the heart and through different
arteries before it meets in CoW. At present, we have not been able to
quantify this shift. Third, the velocity itself may differ at
different times for various reasons. This is illustrated by the cells
containing two values in Table~\ref{measure_vs_comp}, which refer to
two measurements of the same vessel in the same person only 5 weeks
apart.

It is also a great challenge to segment the complete CoW due to great
variations in diameters. This is clearly visible when performing an
automatic segmentation where many of the smaller vessels disappear.
It is known that the BA has approximately 50 tiny vessels that are
clearly not present in Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:screenshot}. The reason
for this is that MRA measurements are based upon velocities, and hence
the velocities in these vessels are too small to be captured. By
calculating and summing up the in- and outflow areas using the code in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:area_code}, we actually get an area difference
of $37.18mm^2-25.33mm^2=11.85mm^2$. It is not known what the correct
area should be.

The simulations also show that it might be problematic to not include
a large fraction of the parent artery when performing simulations on a
smaller fraction of the vasculature. It is common to apply either a
flat velocity profile or a Womersley profile upstream of the location
of interest. This is clearly not the case as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:kvs-2:cok_ica} where the flow is highly non-uniform.
