We describe the implementation of an optimizing compiler for
variational forms based on the discrete optimization methodology
described in an earlier chapter. The major issues are communicating
reference tensors from FFC to the optimizer, FErari, performing the
actual optimization, and communicating abstract syntax for the
optimized algorithm back to FFC for code generation.  We include some
results indicating the kinds of speedups that may be achieved and what
factors influence the effectiveness of the optimizations.
