This chapter discusses some lessons learnt while developing the Python
interface to DOLFIN. It contains the basics of using SWIG to create
Python extensions. Then an explanation of some design choices in
DOLFIN with particular emphasis on operators (and how these are dealt
with in SWIG). Typemaps are explained in the context of NumPy arrays.
Finally, we explain how to debug Python extensions efficiently, eg. by
setting breakpoints.
