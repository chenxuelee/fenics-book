General Galerkin (G2) methods are adaptive stabilized finite element
methods with a posteriori error control. In a unified continuum
mechanics formulation, the basic conservation laws for mass, momentum
and energy are expressed in a general form for fluid and structure
mechanics, which allows for one single implementation for a large
class of continuum mechanics problems using G2, and the FEniCS project
Unicorn is the implementation of this methodology. In this chapter we
review the basic methodology of Unicorn in the form of: Adaptivity and
G2 for incompressible/compressible laminar/turbulent flow and
fluid--structure interation, ALE methods and mesh smoothing.
