* Check captions so they don't run into text                                xx
* Check figure widths                                                       xx
* Check use of : or , before formula                                        xx
* Check bounding boxes for image files, some are very loose                 xx

* Use of "..." vs ``...''                                                   xx
* Use $nn\,\mathrm{mm}$ for quantitites                                     xx
* Write the convective term in NS with \cdot?                               xx

Things to decide
----------------

* Should we use the grey rules above/below figures?

Not yet considered
------------------

* Add http://dx.doi.org/xxxxx link for all papers in reference list, add
  for books too when available
* Add some space around definition environment
* Things to add to a notation section: \partial_n, \delta_{ij}
* Common handling of www:foo references: author name or no author
  name. Looks strange when two packages are referenced together
  and one of them is written as the name of the package and the other
  the name of the author.
