Things to check

* Check bounding boxes for image files. Some are very loose.
* There should be callouts in text to all floats
* Add items to index, should be used in all chapters
* Problem with numbers in Palatino, 0 looks like o. See FFC chapter
  for an example ("Stage 0").
* Use of i for local indices and I for global indices
* Check use of \stackrel{+}{=}
* Check use of : or , before formula
* Make sure that all references are available (insist on archival web
  link for documents that are not readily available, e.g. theses, reports)
* Add http://dx.doi.org/xxxxx link for all papers in reference list. Add
  for books too when available
* Add some space around definition environment
* Make footnotes full page
* Collect code examples and add references
* Use of "..." vs ``...''
* Add labels "C++ code", "Python code", "Bash code" to code
  environments, same as in DOLFIN paper
* Things to add to a notation section in case we add one
  (as requested by one of the referees)

    \partial_n  = normal derivative
    \delta_{ij} = Kronecker delta
* Use \Gamma_{\mathrm{D}} and \Gamma_{\mathrm{N}}
* \emph{a~posteriori} always?
* Check indentation in code examples:
\begin{c++}
stuff
\end{c++}

instead of

\begin{c++}
  stuff
\end{c++}
* Check for % accidentally included in paragraphs as a result of auto-fill

Things to discuss
* Fix width of C++ and Python code environments, seem different
* Use \toprule, \midrule, \bottomrule in tables
* Should there be , after and?
* foo or foo() in text when referring to functions?
* Common handling of www:foo references: author name or no author
  name. Looks strange when two packages are referenced together
  and one of them is written as the name of the package and the other
  the name of the author.
* Full names in author list
* Consistent use of single (') or double (") quotes.
* How to write the convective term in NS: with or without \cdot
* Add another level in numbering (include subsections) suggested by HPL
  who has many references to subsections in the tutorial
* Always italics for Latin like a posteriori?
* Should we include a list of notation?
