Things to check

* There should be callouts in text to all floats
* Add items to index, should be used in all chapters
* Problem with numbers in Palatino, 0 looks like o. See FFC chapter
  for an example ("Stage 0").
* Fix wrapping of chapter titles
* Use {figure*} where suitable
* Use of i for local indices and I for global indices
* Check use of \stackrel{+}{=}
* Check use of : or , before formula
* Make sure that all references are available
* Add some space around definition environment
* Make footnotes full page
* Full names in author list
* Collect code examples and add references
* Use of "..." vs ``...''
* Add labels "C++ code", "Python code", "Bash code" to code
  environments, same as in DOLFIN paper
* Things to add to a notation section in case we add one
  (as requested by one of the referees)

    \partial_n  = normal derivative
    \delta_{ij} = Kronecker delta
* Use \Gamma_{\mathrm{D}} and \Gamma_{\mathrm{N}}
* Check indentation in code examples:
\begin{c++}
stuff
\end{c++}

instead of

\begin{c++}
  stuff
\end{c++}

Things to discuss
* Fix width of C++ and Python code environments, seem different
* Use \toprule, \midrule, \bottomrule in tables
* Should there be , after and?
* foo or foo() in text when referring to functions?
* Common handling of www:foo references: author name or no author
  name. Looks strange when two packages are referenced together
  and one of them is written as the name of the package and the other
  the name of the author.
