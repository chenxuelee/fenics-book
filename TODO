Things to fix
-------------

* Use \center in floats (and not \begin{center} foo \end{center}            xx
* Fix width of C++ and Python code environments, seem different             OK
* Remove chapter header when backmatter starts                              xx
* Change "CG" to "Lagrange" everywhere                                      OK
* Change color in hyperref to something less neon                           xx
* Numbers very small in Palatino, 0 looks like o, see FFC chapter           xx
* Add items to index, should be used in all chapters                        xx
* Collect code examples for all chapters                                    xx
* Use \toprule, \midrule, \bottomrule in tables                             xx
* Fix strange / turning into \ in header for DOLFIN chapter                 OK

Things to check
---------------

* No indentation of first line in code examples                             xx
* No "," after "and" except when necessary                                  xx
* There should be callouts in text to all floats                            xx
* % accidentally included in paragraphs as a result of auto-fill            xx
* Always italics for Latin like a posteriori                                xx
* Full names in author list                                                 xx
* Use \Gamma_{\mathrm{D}} and \Gamma_{\mathrm{N}}                           xx
* Use of double quotes instead of single quote in code, including Python    xx
* Check captions so they don't run into text                                xx
* Check figure widths                                                       xx
* Check use of : or , before formula                                        xx
* Check bounding boxes for image files, some are very loose                 xx
* Check that all references have archival links if not published            xx
* Use of "..." vs ``...''                                                   xx
* Use $nn\,\mathrm{mm}$ for quantitites                                     xx

Things to decide
----------------

* Use foo or foo() in text when referring to functions?
* Include a list of notation?
* How to write the convective term in NS: with or without \cdot?

Not yet considered
------------------

* Add http://dx.doi.org/xxxxx link for all papers in reference list, add
  for books too when available
* Add some space around definition environment
* Things to add to a notation section: \partial_n, \delta_{ij}
* Common handling of www:foo references: author name or no author
  name. Looks strange when two packages are referenced together
  and one of them is written as the name of the package and the other
  the name of the author.
