* Check captions so they don't run into text                                xx

Not yet considered
------------------

* Add http://dx.doi.org/xxxxx link for all papers in reference list, add
  for books too when available
* Add some space around definition environment
* Common handling of www:foo references: author name or no author
  name. Looks strange when two packages are referenced together
  and one of them is written as the name of the package and the other
  the name of the author.
