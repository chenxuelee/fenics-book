Things to check

* There should be callouts in text to all floats
* Add items to index, should be used in all chapters
* Problem with numbers in Palatino, 0 looks like o. See FFC chapter
  for an example ("Stage 0").
* Fix wrapping of chapter titles
* Use {figure*} where suitable
* Use of i for local indices and I for global indices
* Check use of \stackrel{+}{=}
* Check use of : or , before formula
* Make sure that all references are available
* Add some space around definition environment
* Make footnotes full page
* Full names in author list
* Collect code examples and add references
* Use of "..." vs ``...''
* Add labels "C++ code", "Python code", "Bash code" to code
  environments, same as in DOLFIN paper
* Things to add to a notation section in case we add one
  (as requested by one of the referees)

    \partial_n  = normal derivative
    \delta_{ij} = Kronecker delta
